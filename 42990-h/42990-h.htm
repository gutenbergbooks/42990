<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>It may seem that there is little excuse for a new
book on English travel, since works covering the
beaten path in the British Isles fairly teem from the
press. But as a record of pilgrimages to the unfamiliar
shrines and to the odd corners all over the United
Kingdom this book may have its value. My reference
to the tourist-frequented spots has been only incidental,
and I think I can claim to have found much
of interest not elsewhere described. And this I put
forth as my chief excuse for adding one more to the
already long list of British travel books.</p>

<p>But in my illustrations I have another, and perhaps
to many a better, excuse for my venture on such
well-trodden ground. I believe that few books of
travel have come from the press that can justly claim a
higher rank in this particular. The sixteen color
plates reproduce the work of some of the most noted
contemporary artists, and the duogravures are the most
perfect English photographs&mdash;no country on earth
surpasses England in photography&mdash;perfectly reproduced.</p>

<p>I trust that these features may give a real value
to the book and make it acceptable to the large and increasing
number of those readers and travelers abroad
who are interested in the Motherland.</p>

SOME NOOKS ABOUT LONDON</h2>

<p>When Washington Irving made his first journey
to England, he declared the three or four weeks
on the ocean to be the best possible preparation for
a visit to the mother country. The voyage, said he,
was as a blank page in one&rsquo;s existence, and the mind,
by its utter severance from the busy world, was best
fitted to receive impressions of a new and strange
environment. And it was no doubt so in the slow
ocean voyages of olden time; but today it is more
as if one stayed within his palatial hotel for a few
days, at no time losing touch with the civilized world.
Every day of our passage the engines of our ocean
greyhound reeled off distances&mdash;five or six hundred
nautical miles&mdash;that Irving&rsquo;s vessel would have required
nearly a week to cover, and daily the condensed
news of the world was flashed to us through
the &ldquo;viewless air.&rdquo; Of all our modern miracles,
certainly none would have been more difficult to
predict than this&mdash;how like a sheer impossibility it
would have seemed! Indeed, to such an extent has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
modern science thrown its safeguards around the
voyager that &ldquo;those in peril on the sea&rdquo; are rather
less so than those on land, and the ocean liners make
trips month after month and year after year without
the loss of a single life. And with the disappearance
of its mystery and terror, the sea has lost much
of its romance. No longer does the bold buccaneer
lie in wait for the treasure-laden galleons of Spain
and the Netherlands; no longer may the picturesque
pirate sail the seas unhindered in his quest for ill-gotten
gold. Indeed, when one thinks of the capital
and equipment a modern pirate on the high seas
would require, there is no wonder that the good old
trade is obsolete.</p>

<p>But the sea is still as beautiful in its thousand
moods of clouds and sunshine, of storm and calm,
as it ever was ere its distances were annihilated and
its romance dispelled. Our voyage was nearly perfect;
the water was smooth and the days mild and
clear. From sunrise to sunset the great ship plowed
her way through a sea of pale emerald flecked with
frosted silver, and at night she swept along beneath
a starlit sky. So favorable was her progress that
early on the sixth day she paused in Plymouth harbor.</p>

<p>If in Washington Irving&rsquo;s day the long sea voyage
was the best preparation for enjoying the beauties
of England, it is hardly so now. Be that as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
may, there is possibly nothing that could make one
more keenly appreciate the joys of motoring than
the run from Plymouth to London by the Great
Western&rsquo;s &ldquo;train de luxe.&rdquo; The grime and smoke
that envelop everything about the train, the crash
and shriek of the wheels, the trembling and groaning
of the frail carriages hurled onward at a terrific
speed, to say nothing of the never-to-be-forgotten
service&mdash;does it deserve such a term&mdash;of the dining-car,
will all seem like a nightmare when one glides
along beneath the silvery English skies, through the
untainted country air, and pauses for an excellent,
cleanly served luncheon at some well-ordered
wayside inn.</p>

<p>London itself is so vast, and so crowded are
its environs with places that may well engage the
attention of the tourist, that it would be hard to
guess how much time one might devote with pleasure
and profit to the teeming circle within twenty-five
miles of Charing Cross. Many of the most charming
spots about the metropolis have had scant mention
in the literature of travel, and even now many
of the ancient and picturesque villages are in process
of metamorphosis. The steady encroachments of
the great city have already transformed more than
one retired hamlet into a suburban residence town,
and historic landmarks have suffered not a little.
The advent of the railroad, always hailed with joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
from a mere material standpoint, is often death to
the atmosphere that attracts the painter and the poet.
A run to Chorley Wood to visit the studio of a well-known
English artist, one of whose pictures graces
this book, brought to our minds with peculiar force
the condition of things just outlined.</p>

<p>Chorley Wood but recently was one of the
quaintest and most unspoiled of the Hertfordshire
villages. Here stands the old King farmhouse where
in 1672 William Penn married Gulilema Springett,
whose graces and perfections have been so dwelt
upon by the chroniclers. And there are other old
and interesting structures, but crowding them closely
and elbowing them out of existence are the more
modern villas of Londoners whom the railroad has
brought within easy reach of this pleasant spot.
Not all of the newer houses were constructed with
the consummate taste of that of our artist friend,
whose studio-residence seemed entirely at home
among the quaint old houses of the town. As usual
with English houses, the garden side was most attractive,
and a wide veranda&mdash;not a common thing
in England&mdash;fronted on the well-kept lawn. From
this there was a splendid view of the distant Hertfordshire
landscape, which on this particular June
day was glorious with such variations of green as
can be seen only in England, broken here and there
by the intense yellow of the gorse and fading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
away into a blue haze that half hid the forest-covered
hills in the distance. I could not help suggesting
that this view itself would make a delightful picture,
but the artist, who is noted for his fondness for
low tones, demurred&mdash;the gorse was too harsh and
jarring. So, after all, Dame Nature isn&rsquo;t much of
a colorist! She mingles the intensest greens and
blues and dashes them with the fiercest of yellows!</p>

<p>It is not strange that Hertfordshire is favored
by the artists, especially those whose success has
been such as to enable them to maintain country
homes. I had the pleasure of calling on another successful
young painter in the adjacent village of Harpenden
and on inquiring for his studio we were given
the unique direction to &ldquo;follow the road along the
common until you come to a new house that looks
like an old one.&rdquo; And the description was apt, indeed,
for we did not see elsewhere the half-timber
frame-work with herring-bone masonry, the studded
oak doors with monstrous, straggling wrought-iron
hinges, the open beams, wide carved mantels, the
mullioned windows with diamond panes set in iron
casements&mdash;all reproduced with the perfect spirit
of the Elizabethan builder.</p>

<p>Near by is Rickmansworth, an ancient and yet
unspoiled town where Penn lived for five years after
his marriage with &ldquo;Guli,&rdquo; as she was called.
These years were largely occupied in writing theo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>logical
works and in public religious disputations.
In fact, no name is more identified with Hertfordshire
than Penn&rsquo;s, its only rival being that of Francis
Bacon. In later years Penn removed to Sussex,
where he had inherited an estate, but his final resting-place
is at Jordans, Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>We left Chorley Wood through meandering
byways, and threading our way among the Burnham
beeches, soon came into the main Oxford road.
It would be difficult, indeed, to describe the sylvan
loveliness of the country through which we passed.
The great trees overarched the narrow winding lanes,
which were bordered with tall ferns in places, and
often a clear rivulet ran alongside. The somber
yew, the stately oak and the graceful birches were
interspersed here with a bit of lawn and there with
a tangle of flowering shrubs. Out of this we came
into the main road, broad and white, and teeming
with vehicles&mdash;the first hint that London with its
ceaseless turmoil is only twenty miles away.</p>

<p>Farther on the road toward the city we came to
Uxbridge, another town where the new is crowding
the old. Fortunately, the famous Treaty Inn has
escaped. Here the emissaries of Charles I. met the
representatives of Parliament in a vain effort to compromise
the dispute that had plunged the nation into
civil war. The room where the commissioners met,
with its paneling reaching to the ceiling and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
wealth of antique carving, is little changed, though
it has been divided by a partition into a writing- and
a dining-room. The excellent luncheon served was
one of the surprises often met in these dilapidated
and often unprepossessing old hostelries. In the
time of the Parliamentary unpleasantness, this hotel
was known as the &ldquo;Crown,&rdquo; and among its relics
is an immense crown of solid oak weighing two or
three hundred pounds, which was engaging the attention
of an English party, one of whom ironically
asked if this were the identical crown worn by
Charles at the council. &ldquo;Indeed it was,&rdquo; replied
another humorist in the party, &ldquo;and thus originated
the expression, &lsquo;Uneasy lies the head which wears
a crown.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Near Uxbridge, but lying a quarter of a mile
off the main road, is the village of Denham. Here
we came one fine Sunday afternoon, following the
recommendation of an English friend. The village
has no historic attraction and no famous man&rsquo;s name
has ever been associated with it. Neither has it
mention in the books. Yet Denham is a delight&mdash;a
sequestered little place nestling under a group of
towering trees just far enough from the highroad to
miss the dust and noise. The ancient half-timbered
houses which border the street are redolent with
the spirit of old-time England. The fine unrestored
old church stands at the head of the street and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
churchyard about it shows evidence of painstaking
care. What a delight, it seemed to us, it would be
to live in Denham&mdash;at least in English June time.
One would have rural quiet, even somnolence, and
might lie for hours on the turf under the great trees,
meditating and looking at the sky; and if he should
weary of so secluded and eventless a life, London,
with all its mystery and charm, is less than an hour
away&mdash;London, the most fascinating city in the
world, despite its preponderance of bad weather and
its world-famed fogs.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb delighted in Hertfordshire and
spent much of his time at the Four Swans Inn at
Waltham, a quaint old building just opposite Waltham
Cross. We made several pilgrimages here;
nor did the abbey grow less interesting upon repeated
visits. From here it is only a little distance
to St. Albans, a city proud of its great cathedral,
whose hoary tower dominates the town. Quite different
from the ordinary caretaker was the young
clergyman, whose refined, classic face bespoke
his intelligence and who showed us every detail of
the great church, dwelling upon its many ancient
and often unique features. Nor did he omit to call
our attention to an epitaph of a very frank citizen
of St. Albans, who, after sleeping three hundred
years under the marble slab in the nave, still complains
of his unhappy fate:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Great was my grief&mdash;I could not rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God called me hence&mdash;He thought it best.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy marriage was my fate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did repent when &rsquo;twas too late.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>St. Albans is rich in antiquities. Indeed, you
can still trace fragments of the Roman wall which
surrounded the place when Albanus met his fate,
and down near the river at the foot of cathedral
hill is another &ldquo;oldest house&rdquo; in England. It is a
quaint round structure, built, they say, more than
a thousand years ago as a fishing-lodge for the
monks, for it stands hard by a lakelike dam in the
river. But today it has degenerated into a public
house, and the broad-shouldered, black-bearded
Irishman who kept the bar was well posted on St.
Albans&rsquo; antiquities. He showed us the little house
and garden and pointed out the Roman earthworks.
Nor did he seem in the least disappointed that our
patronage was limited to a few post card pictures,
and, strange to say, he declined a gratuity. We returned
to the George Inn, which enjoyed great prosperity
in the coaching days, being on the main road
to Holyhead. For four hundred years it had cheered
the passing guest and its excellent dinner belied its
generally dilapidated appearance. Its proprietors
were just removing to the new and pretentious Red
Lion over the way, but we did not learn whether
this meant the final abandonment of the George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>It was with some difficulty that we located
Rye House, which we supposed to be within Broxborne,
but which really lies on a byroad two or
three miles away. Though in a more or less secluded
location, it is apparently the goal of innumerable
pilgrims on gala days in the summer, especially
Sundays. On the day of our arrival, the
grounds were quite deserted and an appropriate
quietude hovered over the old manor. Alas, though,
we found it shorn of much of its picturesqueness, for
it had fallen into the clutches of a large brewer, who
was using it as an adjunct to dispose of his product&mdash;in
fact, the mansion and its beautiful grounds have
become little else than a summer beer garden.</p>

<p>Rye House figures in history as the seat of a
plot, which contemporaries describe as &ldquo;horrid,&rdquo;
to kill King Charles II. as he returned from a race
meeting in Newmarket in 1683. Unfortunately,
perhaps, the plot failed, owing to the king&rsquo;s return
a week earlier than expected, and there was no telephone
to advise the Rye House assassins of the
change of plan. A penny guide-book gives what
purports to be the history of the crime, though I
fear most of the romantic features are mythical. It
relates how Ruth, the daughter of Rumsey, who
devised the plot, listened at the door and learned
the plan of the conspirators. Between her father and
the king this devoted maiden never hesitated a min<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>ute,
but hustled her lover away to Newmarket to
warn Charles of his impending danger. After great
difficulty the youth gained an audience with the
king, and it is recorded that Charles only laughed
at his story. Here, at least, is a touch of probability&mdash;Charles
laughed at everything. Finding
himself discredited, the lover became desperate; in
his loyal zeal &ldquo;he secretly set fire to the house in
which the king resided in two or three places.&rdquo;
Our chronicler, having thus unceremoniously ousted
his royal majesty from his comfortable quarters, has
him proceed &ldquo;in disguise&rdquo; to London, stopping at
Rye House, where he confronted and confounded
his enemies and bestowed &ldquo;substantial marks of his
favor&rdquo; upon Ruth Rumsey and her lover. What
these substantial marks were our chronicler declareth
not&mdash;better left to the imagination, anyway, for
it would be far more in keeping with the character
of Charles to say that he promised substantial marks
of his favor and forgot all about it.</p>

<p>So much for Rye House legend. The facts
are that the conspirators were apprehended and executed,
and quite in accordance with his usual practices,
the king made the circumstance an excuse for
the removal of numerous of his enemies among the
nobility who had nothing whatever to do with the
plot. However, Rye House is quiet enough today
and its only plots are the innocuous ones hatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
over pots of beer in the minds of the trippers who
throng it on Sundays and holidays.</p>

<p>The conspirators did not meet at the inn
itself, but in the castellated manor house just
across the byroad. Of this only a fragment remains,
but fortunately this fragment contains the
&ldquo;conspirators&rsquo; room,&rdquo; as might be expected. The
enterprising brewer has put this in good repair and
has placed on view a number of relics of greater or
less degree of merit. Among these is a pair of stupendous
jack-boots, which our voluble guide assured
us were the &ldquo;hidentical boots what Holiver Cromwell
wore&rdquo; during a battle in which, as usual, he
worsted the Royalists; but the placard above the
relics was more modest in its claims, for it only stated
that the boots were found on the battlefield. However,
if the redoubtable &ldquo;Holiver&rdquo; wore these boots
or anything like unto them when he met the enemy,
one phase of his career may be accounted for&mdash;why
he never ran away. Among the other curiosities
with a real interest is the &ldquo;Great Bed of Ware,&rdquo; so
famous in its day that Shakespeare immortalized it
in his &ldquo;Twelfth Night.&rdquo; It is certainly a marvelous
creation, some sixteen feet square, with enormous
carved posts supporting an imposing canopy. Our
guide asserted that in its early days no fewer than
twenty-four men had slept in it at one time, and recited,
in painful detail, the history of the bed. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
inconsiderately interrupted him in the midst of his
declamation and he had to start all over again, to
his manifest annoyance. Even then he failed to finish,
for the shadows were lengthening, and terminating
his flow of eloquence with a shilling or two,
we were soon speeding swiftly over the beautiful
Chigwell road to London.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a><br />
WANDERINGS IN EAST ANGLIA</h2>

<p>Despite the fascination that London always
has and the fact that one could scarcely exhaust her
attractions in years, it was with impatience that we
endured the delay imposed by business matters and
preparations for a period of two months or more
on the road. We were impatient, surely, or we
should hardly have left our hotel at six o&rsquo;clock in
the evening, in the face of a driving rain. Ordinarily,
two or three hours would have brought us to
Cambridge, only fifty miles away; but we could
not depend on this with the caution necessary on the
slippery streets in getting out of London.</p>

<p>Once clear of the city there was little to hamper
us on the fine Cambridge road and we counted
on easily reaching the university town before lamplighting.
The rain had nearly ceased, but the downpour
had been tremendous, and in three successive
valleys we forded floods, each one deeper than the
preceding. Almost before we knew it&mdash;for in the
gas lamps&rsquo; glare the rain-soaked road looked little
different from the yellow water&mdash;we were axle-deep
in a fourth torrent and were deluged with a dirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
spray from the engine fly-wheel. Manifestly we
were not to reach Cambridge that night and we reluctantly
turned about to seek shelter somewhere
else.</p>

<p>It was only a little way to the village of Buntingford,
where we found clean though very unpretentious
and not altogether comfortable accommodations
at the George, a rambling old relic of coaching
days. Our late dinner was fair and our rooms good-sized
and neat, though dimly lit with tallow candles;
but the ancient feather beds, our greatest terror in
the smaller and a few of the larger towns, caused a
well-nigh sleepless night. Morning revealed a little
straggling gray-stone and slate village, unchanged
to all appearances from the days of the coach-and-four.
Our inn was a weather-beaten structure, and
its facilities for dispensing liquor appeared by odds
greater than its accommodation for non-bibulous
travelers. Still, it was clean and homelike, in spots
at least, and our hostess, who personally looked after
our needs, was all kindness and sympathetic attention.
Altogether, we had little complaint to lodge
against the George, though greatly different from
the really admirable University Arms at Cambridge,
where we had planned to stop. We were early on
the road, from which nearly all trace of the floods
of the previous evening had vanished, and before
long we were threading the familiar streets of Cam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>bridge,
where everything appeared to be in a bustle
of preparation&mdash;at least so far as such a state of affairs
could be in a staid English town&mdash;for the closing
of the University year on the following week.</p>

<p>There is no finer road in England than that
leading from Cambridge to Newmarket. It is nearly
level, and having been newly surfaced with yellow
gravel, it stretches before us like a long golden
ribbon in the sunshine. It leads through wide meadow-lands
and at times runs straight away as an arrow&rsquo;s
flight&mdash;truly a tempting highway for the light-footed
motor car.</p>

<p>Beyond Newmarket the road to Bury St. Edmunds
is quite as fine, and no doubt this splendid
highway is largely responsible for the intense antipathy
to the motor car in the former town. However,
one would hardly expect Newmarket to be
wildly enthusiastic over the horseless carriage, for
this ancient burg contests with Epsom for the position
of chief horse-racing town in England&mdash;a
proud distinction it had held for some centuries before
the motor snorted through its streets. Another
cause for the grief of the townsmen was the complaint
of owners of high-bred horses that the motors
jarred upon the nerves of the spirited animals to
their great detriment, and naturally enough the citizens
sympathized with their patron saint, the horse,
against his petrol-driven rival. And thus it was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
when we entered Newmarket we were met by the
Motor Union scout, who cautioned us to observe
rigidly the ten-mile limit or we would more than
likely share the fate of a half dozen of our brethren
the day before&mdash;a journey to police headquarters.
Two months afterwards, when we again passed
through the town, the war was still on, and it was
some months later that I read in the daily papers
that after great bitterness on both sides a truce had
finally been reached.</p>

<p>Despite its unfriendliness toward our ilk, we
must admit that Newmarket is quite a modern-looking
town, clean and attractive, with many fine buildings
and excellent hotels. It lies in the midst of
wide meadow-lands, much used for horseback
sports such as polo and racing. Royal visits, so dear
to the average Britisher, are a frequent event, and
here it is that the King, usually in some new style
of hat or cut of trousers, appears, to set the world of
fashion agog.</p>

<p>Well clear of Newmarket and its birds of prey,
the most glorious of roads brought us quickly into
the fine old town of Bury St. Edmunds&mdash;and none
other in East Anglia has been celebrated by greater
pens; for Charles Dickens and Thomas Carlyle sojourned
at Bury and left us vigorous records of
their impressions. The former set them down in
the story of the trials and wanderings of Mr. Pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>wick,
and that honest old gentleman&rsquo;s comment on
the town and its famous Angel Inn was altogether
commendatory. It was later&mdash;in 1878&mdash;when Carlyle
visited Bury, and the description he gave it then
is quite applicable today. He saw &ldquo;a prosperous,
brisk town looking out right pleasantly from the hill-slope
toward the rising sun, and on the eastern edge
still runs, long, black and massive, a maze of monastic
ruins.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; we found still deserving
of the encomiums bestowed by Mr. Pickwick, a delightfully
clean and quiet old inn fronting directly on
the abbey gardens and presided over by a suave and
very accommodating landlord. We were given
spacious and well-lighted quarters&mdash;we may dwell
on &ldquo;well-lighted,&rdquo; since we could hardly apply this
description, so far as artificial light is concerned, to
more than two or three of the hundreds of hotels we
visited.</p>

<p>The most impressive feature of the abbey ruin
is the massive square tower of the gateway, which
stands intact, its ancient state almost undiminished.
The abbey has a long history, for Edmund, King
of East Anglia, was slain near at hand by the Danes
in 870&mdash;legend says because he refused to abjure
Christianity, and it was this that won his canonization
as St. Edmund. To the time of the Dissolution
the abbey was by far the greatest in East Anglia,
and its ruins, though fragmentary, are quite suf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>ficient
to indicate its once vast extent. Near by stand
the churches of St. James and St. Mary&rsquo;s, both
rather ill-proportioned for lack of towers&mdash;a deficiency
due, it is said, to the old-time abbots&rsquo; fear that
if these churches should be thus ornamented they
would overshadow the abbey church, now entirely
vanished. Good authorities state that St. Mary&rsquo;s
has the finest open roof in England. It is supported
on slender columns and covers a well-proportioned
nave. In the church is the tomb of Mary Tudor,
sister of Henry VIII. and wife first of Louis XII. of
France and afterwards of Charles Brandon, Duke
of Suffolk.</p>

<p>There is not much of historic interest in Bury
aside from its abbey and churches. One may occupy
a pleasant hour or two in walking about the
town, which, despite its antiquity, has a prosperous
and up-to-date appearance. Twice in the course of
our rambles we visited it and on both occasions our
route led to Ipswich, though over different roads&mdash;first
due south through Lavenham and Hadleigh and
later by the way of Stowmarket. The former route
is mainly through the retired Suffolk byways, not
in the best condition, but bordered by charming
country. Nowhere did we see a more delightful
brick-and-timber house than the old manor at Brent
Eleigh, though it has degenerated into a mere farm
tenement rather better cared for than usual. What a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
world of quaint and ancient beauty there is in its
many red-tiled gables surmounted by great clustered
chimneys, its double mullioned windows and its
black-oak and red-brick walls, splashed here and
there with clinging masses of ivy. Our illustration
only half tells the story, for it does not give the color
or the most picturesque view of the house. We also
came across Bildeston, a little out-of-the-way hamlet
lost in the hills, which has many old houses not
as yet fallen into the clutches of the restorer. This
is also true of Hadleigh, a little farther on the road,
which is rich in seventeenth century houses with
fronts of ornamental plaster and carved oaken beams.
Among the very oddest of these is the guildhall,
standing quite apart in a graveyard thickly set with
weather-worn headstones.</p>

<div class="center">
<a name="bw_01" id="bw_01"></a><img src="images/bw_01.jpg" width="600" height="419" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OLD MANOR HOUSE, BRENT ELEIGH.</p>
</div>

<p>We reached Ipswich after a half day of slow
progress, for signboards were often missing and the
winding lanes bordered by high hedges made cautious
driving imperative. Later we followed the
road by Stowmarket, a much easier though less interesting
route. Stowmarket, aside from its old-world
streets and its huge church with an odd wooden
spire, had nothing to detain us, for one would
hardly care to linger at the gun-cotton factory, which
is the most distinctive feature of the village.</p>

<p>Little provision was made by the burghers who
centuries ago platted the streets of Ipswich, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
coming of the motor or electric tram, and it was with
difficulty that our car was able to thread its way
through the narrow, crowded main street. It goes
without saying that the objective of the pilgrim on
entering the city will be the Great White
Horse, the scene of some of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
most noted adventures, nor are we deterred by
any recollection of his decidedly unpleasant experiences
with the inn people. Like many
of the incidents in his writings, it was the personal
experience of Dickens that called forth the
rather uncomplimentary remarks set down against the
ancient hostelry; but the very fact that Charles Dickens
had stopped there and written&mdash;no matter what&mdash;of
the Great White Horse&mdash;is that not enough?
And we could not forget if we wished that an exact
replica of the Great White Horse was exhibited
at the Chicago Fair as typical of the old-time English
inn, for the fact is blazoned forth by a large
placard in the hall. We were offered the spacious
room, with its imposing, tall-posted beds, traditionally
occupied by Mr. Pickwick. The Great White
Horse, like many other institutions that felt the
scourge of the caustic pen of Dickens, has changed;
no better ordered, more comfortable and attentive
hostelry did we find elsewhere, and we felt that it
had outlived the bad reputation the great author gave
it, even as America lived down the bitter scourging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of the &ldquo;American Notes,&rdquo; beneath which our fellow-countrymen
writhed at the time. And perhaps
we still think of the &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit&rdquo;
with a twinge of bitterness, forgetting that the
ridicule which Dickens indulged in concerning
America was hardly comparable to the sharp castigations
he administered to his own countrymen. His
work was productive of good in both countries, and
most of the evils he so scathingly rebuked no longer
exist.</p>

<p>Ipswich, though a city of some seventy thousand
people and of considerable activity, is by no
means shorn of its old-time interest and picturesqueness.
There are many crooked old-world streets
where the soft, time-mellowed tones of the gray walls
and antique gables are diversified by carved beams,
plaster fronts and diamond-paned windows, each of
which has its box of brightly colored flowers. The
most notable of the old houses and one of the noblest
specimens of Tudor architecture in the Kingdom
is &ldquo;Ye Ancient House,&rdquo; with its odd dormer windows
and richly decorated plaster front, situated near
the Butter Market. The interior, now occupied by
a bookshop and public library, is as unique and
pleasing as the outside. There are paneled rooms,
odd passages and corners, and a very quaint though
rude chapel directly beneath the heavy arched timber
roof. Of course such a striking old house must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
have its legend of royalty, and tradition has it that
Charles II. was hidden in the chapel when seeking
passage to France after the battle of Worcester.</p>

<p>But the charm of Ipswich may serve no longer
as an excuse to linger. We bid regretful farewell
to the Great White Horse and are soon following
the King&rsquo;s highway to the northward. It was a lowering
day, with frequent dashes of rain and glints of
sun breaking from a sky as blue as one may see in our
own prairie states in June time. The road is winding
and hilly for East Anglia, which is so generally
level, but it passes through a fine country with many
retired, old-world villages. Lowestoft we find another
of the numerous seaside resorts that dot the southeastern
coast. It has figured little in history and
doubtless the most notable event in its career was
its prompt surrender to Colonel Cromwell in 1642.</p>

<p>It was gray and chilly when we entered Great
Yarmouth, where we found a leaden-colored ocean
thundering on the finest beach in the Kingdom.
Yarmouth is popular as a resort town, though more
widely known for its fisheries. Its characteristic feature
is its &ldquo;rows,&rdquo; a series of very narrow alleys,
mostly bordered with shops and opening into the
main street, forming, as Dickens puts it, &ldquo;one vast
gridiron of which the bars are represented by the
rows.&rdquo; And one will notice that Dickens is much
in evidence in East Anglia. Who can ever forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the freshness of the description of Yarmouth in &ldquo;David
Copperfield&rdquo;? The hotels, as might be expected,
are many, and some of them excellent; nowhere did
we have better service than at the Victoria, though
cheapness is not one of its attractions.</p>

<p>Historic ruins, as a rule, are now carefully
maintained in England and often made a feature of
parks and pleasure grounds. But there are exceptions,
where the onslaughts of decay are not withstood
and where, unhindered, green ruin creeps
steadily on. Such we found Caister Castle, four
miles to the north of Yarmouth. We were attracted
by its imposing appearance at some distance from
the main road, and the byway into which we turned
led into an ill-kept farmyard. Here stands the impressive
ruin, with the stagnant waters of its old-time
moat still surrounding the towering keep and shattered
walls. It was quite deserted, apparently serving
the neighboring farmer as a hen-roost. We
learned little of its history, but the mystery, due to
our very ignorance, together with the sad abandon
of Caister Castle, makes it appeal to our imagination
more strongly than many a well-cared-for ruin whose
story has become commonplace.</p>

<p>A broad, level road leads to Norwich and we
ran through the flat fen country, dotted here and
there with the Norfolk Broads. These pretty inland
lakes lay dull and motionless under a leaden sky, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
we could imagine them very picturesque on bright
days, rippling in the sun and gleaming with white
sails. The hour was late, but our flight was a rapid
one, soon bringing us to the East Anglian metropolis,
where we forthwith sought the Maid&rsquo;s Head Hotel.</p>

<p>On the following morning we set out to explore
the northern coast of Norfolk and our route led
us through many byways and over much bad road.
The day was clear and cool and the fine level country
was in the full glory of June verdure. Everything
seemed to indicate that the East Anglian farmer
is contented and prosperous in the small way that
prosperity comes to the common people of England.
The countryside had a well-groomed appearance and
the houses were better than the average. We proceeded
almost due north to Mundesley, a mean,
bleak little coast town with a single crooked street,
its straggling cottages contrasting sharply with the
palatial hotel in the midst of lawns and gardens on
the hill overlooking the sea.</p>

<p>Eastward from Mundesley we ran directly
along the ocean, which is visible most of the time;
the road is stony and steep in places&mdash;altogether the
worst we had yet traversed. The coast country is
decidedly different from the fertile and pleasant fields
of the interior. It is bleak and drab-colored; there
are vast stretches of sand dunes bordered with stony
hills whose dull colorings are relieved by patches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
yellow gorse and groups of stunted trees. The villages
are in keeping with the country. The houses
are of gray stone and broken flints and roofed with
slate or dull-red tiles; the lines are square and harsh
and there are no touches of ornament. Even the
numerous churches partake of these characteristics;
they are huge in bulk, with little or no attempt at
artistic effect, often crowning some hilltop and looking
as if they had defied the wild sea winds for ages.
One we especially noted, standing quite apart on a
hill overlooking the ocean&mdash;a vast weather-worn
church with a square-topped tower in front and a
queer little minaret to the rear&mdash;altogether an imposing
and unusual structure. It completely dominates
the poverty-stricken country and the mean little
villages, the nearest of which is a half-mile away.</p>

<p>The principal resource of the towns of the north
Norfolk coast is resort hotels and boarding-houses.
We saw them without number at Mundesley, Hunstanton,
Cromer, Well-Next-the-Sea, and at solitary
points along the road. The fine beach in many
places, the rough but picturesque country and the
unusual quiet of the surroundings no doubt prove attractive
to many seeking rest. At Wells-Next-the-Sea
we were glad indeed to forsake the wretched
coast road for the broad white highway that leads
by the way of Fakenham to Norwich.</p>

<p>A few miles out of Norwich on the Newmar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ket
road is Wymondham, noted for its odd timber
cross and its ancient priory church with octagonal
towers, which give it, from a distance, a rather unchurchlike
appearance. The extent of the ruins still
remaining is sufficient evidence that at one time Wymondham
Priory was of no little importance. Most
remarkable is the open roof, the oaken timbers of
which were removed at the Dissolution, and after
being stored away for ages, were again put in place
at the recent restoration. The caretaker showed us
about with the pride so common to his calling; but
he heaved a sigh as he pointed out many costly features
of restoration, such as the great screen, the massive
bronze chandeliers and many elaborate carvings
and furnishings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these were all donated by
the late vicar; he carried out and paid for a large
part of the restoration&mdash;but he&rsquo;s gone now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; we sympathetically asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! It was all the fault of his landlady,
who became displeased with him somehow and
gave him notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble about the rent?&rdquo; we suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; was the indignant reply. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>&ldquo;The
rent was nothing to him. He is the youngest brother
of the Duke of W&mdash;&mdash;, and is very wealthy, with
a large following. There is only one house to let
in the parish that could accommodate him at all;
and so he had to leave; yes, he had to leave, for
one day he says to me, &lsquo;Did you ever hear of a
minister getting the sack?&rsquo; And he told me how
badly his landlady had treated him and that he had
to go. It was a sad day for Wymondham, sir. He
had spent ten times his salary on the church and
there were many other things he was about to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much is the salary?&rdquo; we asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six hundred pounds. It is a large parish,
covering thirty-five square miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We gave the old man his expected fee and
thought it strange to learn of a minister who had
restored a great church from his private fortune and
then had to give up his charge because there was only
one available house to accommodate him and he
couldn&rsquo;t have that. Surely the captious landlady
must be execrated by the good members of the
Priory Church of Wymondham.</p>

<p>It may seem a far cry from Wymondham, with
its ecclesiastical traditions, to Thetford, the birthplace
of that arch-heretic, Thomas Paine; yet it is
only a few miles over the finest of roads. The village
still preserves its old-world atmosphere and
the house where Paine was born still stands, and is
frequented, we learned, by many pilgrims. The
old Bell Inn, the oddest of hostelries, looked cozy
and restful, though we did not seek its hospitality.
We hastened onward, leaving the Newmarket high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>way
for Mildenhall, a quiet, unprogressive little village
with an interesting manor house. This we did
not see after all, for it chanced that it was closed during
preparations for an open-air Shakespearean play
in the park that afternoon. We paused in the market
square and were accosted by a friendly disposed
native who thought us at a loss for the road. We
thanked him and asked him what there might be
of interest in Mildenhall. He scratched his head
reflectively and finally said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin, sir! Hi &rsquo;ave lived in Mildenhall for
forty years and never saw anything of hinterest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Discouraging, indeed! but we dissented, for
there is much in the little town to please one in
whom familiarity has not bred contempt. The huge,
rambling Bell Inn seemed wonderfully attractive,
though quite out of proportion to the village at present.
Facing the inn is the church, remarkable for
its Early English windows and fine open hammer-beam,
carved-oak roof, supported from corbels of
angel figures with extended wings. Quite as unusual
is the hexagonal market cross, built of heavy oak
timbers, gracefully carved, which support the leaden
roof. Besides these ancient landmarks, there is
much else pleasing in Mildenhall. The thatched
cottages, brilliant flower gardens and narrow streets,
all combine to make it a snug, charming place where
one might quite forget the workaday world without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Later in our wanderings we made another incursion
into East Anglia, and retraced our route over
many of its fine highways. We paused at Colchester
and sought out some of the odd corners we missed
before. On leaving the old city we wandered from
the London road into quiet byways in search of
Layer Marney, of whose stupendous ruined towers
we had read years ago. After no end of inquiry,
we came in sight of these, only to learn that the ruin
had been incorporated into a modern mansion by a
London gentleman and was no longer accessible to
visitors. Still, we were able to come quite close and
found work still in progress&mdash;a number of men laying
out formal gardens about the house. The interest
centers in the gate towers built four hundred
years ago by Lord Marney, who planned to erect
a mansion to correspond with his exalted station.
But his unfinished work stands as a monument to his
blighted hopes, for he died before his task was well
begun and his only son followed him a year later.
The structure is strikingly original in style; the entrance
flanked by great octagonal towers eight stories
high, with two immense windows&mdash;a network of
stone mullions&mdash;just above the gateway. It was one
of the earliest buildings since Roman times to be constructed
of brick, and most unusual are the terra cotta
moldings, which have a classic touch, due to Italian
workmen brought to England by Lord Marney.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">MARNEY TOWERS, ESSEX.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>The little church near by, of earlier date than
the towers, is also built of brick and has so far escaped
the ravages of the restorer. It has three black
marble tombs of old-time Marneys and one of these
must be older than the church, for it bears the mail-clad
effigy of a crusader who died in 1414. The
interior has scarcely been altered in the four hundred
years of its existence; and we hardly saw another to
match it in genuine spirit of the olden time. The
roof of the nave had been repaired out of sheer necessity,
but the dark, sagging beams of the chapel had
never been molested. Over the door a black letter
inscription, with initial and decorations in still brilliant
red, is devoted to a scathing denunciation of
&ldquo;ye riche,&rdquo; so fierce as to seem almost modern. Perhaps
the Marneys viewed it with the more complacency
from the fact that their worldly possessions
hardly accorded with their high station. One of the
oddest features of the interior is the carved oaken effigies
of four little monkeys perched on tall posts at
either end of the family pews, and an ape is shown
on the Marney arms. All because, tradition declares,
a pet monkey snatched a prehistoric Marney
while an infant from a burning mansion and lost its
life to save the child.</p>

SOME MIDLAND NOOKS AND THE WASHINGTON
COUNTRY</h2>

<p>It was not easy to get rooms at the University
Arms, even though we had applied the week before.
It was the close of the university year, for
which event, the manageress assured us, many people
had engaged rooms a full year in advance. We
were late applicants, to be sure. However, we had
the advantage of a previous acquaintance&mdash;a thing
that counts for much in the English hotel&mdash;and, since
nowhere else would do, we were soon comfortably
established at the University Arms.</p>

<p>A stop of a day or two gives us the opportunity
of seeing much of the gala life of the town,
including the hotly contested boat races on the Cam.
There are many events not directly connected with
the university, among them the cart-horse parade,
which includes hundreds of gaily decked work-horses,
splendid fellows, and it is doubtful if any
American town of twice the size of Cambridge
could make anything like such a showing, all points
of equine excellence considered. One sees very few
poor-looking horses in England, anyway&mdash;outside of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
London. But what have we to do with horses?
We are again on the road at the earliest opportunity,
following the splendid highway to Huntingdon.
The countryside through which we pass is
crowded with memories of the Great Protector, but
we shall give it no place in this chronicle of unfamiliar
England.</p>

<p>The old Bell Inn at Stilton, on the Great
North Road fourteen miles above Huntingdon, will
arrest the attention of any one who has learned to
discriminate. It is a relic of the time when this road
was one of the busiest in all England&mdash;the coaching
traffic between London, York and Edinburgh plying
over it. The inn fronts directly on the street&mdash;a
long, rambling building, with many gables, stone-mullioned
windows and huge, square, clustered chimneys.
It is built of sandstone, weatherworn to a soft,
yellowish brown, and once rich in mouldings and
carvings which are now barely discernible. Now
only about half of the house is occupied and the
stables have fallen in ruin. The village of Stilton
is one of the sleepiest and most rural type. What a
contrast the good old days must have presented when
six and thirty coaches-and-four pulled up daily at
the Bell and its hostlers led nearly one hundred
horses to its capacious stables!</p>

<p>We saw much of rural England in threading
our way from Stilton through a maze of narrow by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>roads
to Oundle, which caught our eye as one of
the quaintest of the old-world inland villages. Many
are the pleasant vistas down its streets, each with
its array of buildings in soft-gray and red tones, the
sagging roofs surmounted by odd gables and huge
chimneys. But most interesting are the old inns, the
Turk&rsquo;s Head and the Talbot. The first is an imposing
Jacobean structure with many gables and
deep-set stone-mullioned windows. The Talbot
is quite as fine in exterior, and though we could
not remain as guests, the landlord apparently took
pleasure in showing us about, manifesting a genuine
pride in his establishment, which was further evidenced
by its well-kept appearance. Even the
court was flower-bordered and there was a flourishing
greenhouse. Inside there are rooms with much
antique paneling and solid oaken beams which support
the ceilings. But most notable are the relics
of Fotheringhay Castle incorporated into the Talbot.
The winding black-oak staircase is the one which
Mary descended on the mournful morning of her
execution, and among the mullioned casement windows
are doubtless some through which the fair captive
often gazed during the long, weary days of her
imprisonment.</p>

<p class="caption">CROSS ROADS NEAR OUNDLE.</p>
</div>

<p>There are few places in the average village
where the tourist can gain local information so easily
as at a picture postcard shop. The keeper is sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to call your attention to everything of interest and is
equally sure to be well posted on the history and traditions
of the locality. Such a shop we found at
Oundle, and the pictures of Deane House and
Church and Kirby Hall soon engaged our attention.
&ldquo;Do not miss them,&rdquo; said the genial shopkeeper, and
he gave us accurate directions as to the roads&mdash;not
easy to follow from the confusing streets of Oundle
into another tangle of byways.</p>

<p>Deane House, the fine Tudor residence of the
Earls of Cardigan, is a few miles to the northwest.
It is not shown to visitors, but its battlemented towers,
odd turrets and heavily buttressed walls are plainly
visible from the road. Near it stands Deane
Church, whose fine open-timbered roof is supported by
slender oaken columns&mdash;quite unusual, indeed.
There is a beautiful sixteenth century tomb, its details
almost perfect, with the effigies of the first earl
and his two wives placed impartially on either side.
But nowhere else did we see an altar-tomb so chaste
and artistic as that erected to the late earl, who died
in 1868. It is wrought in purest alabaster, and beside
the figure of the earl, represented as a tall,
handsome man in full military dress, is the effigy of
his widow, not interred with her husband as yet,
but living at the age of eighty-four. Evidently the
lady desires that future ages shall remember her at
her best, for the effigy represents a transcendently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
beautiful young woman of about twenty, lying calmly
in sleep, her head resting on a gracefully rounded
arm and her face turned toward her mate. Every
detail is delicately and correctly done and the whole
work is redolent of beauty and sentiment. Will it
ever see such cataclysms as swept over its companion
tomb? May no iconoclastic vandal ever shatter
those slenderly wrought hands or carve his churlish
name on the stately figure of the earl&mdash;and yet how
often such desecrations have occurred in England in
the not very distant past!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are absolutely no restrictions on visitors
at Kirby Hall,&rdquo; we were informed at Oundle,
and it might have been added that no effort is made
to direct one thither. We passed unwittingly and
were compelled to turn about to find the common-looking
farm gate that opened through the hedgerow
into the rough, stone-strewn bit of road leading to the
dismantled palace. So uninviting was the neglected
lane that two or three English motorists who arrived
about the same time left their cars and walked
the mile or so to the Hall. It was not our wont to
be so cautious, and we drove directly to the stately
though crumbling gateway. As we rounded a group
of trees and caught a full view of the splendid facade
of Kirby Hall, we could not repress an exclamation
of surprise. Beautiful and imposing, indeed, despite
long years of neglect and decay, is this mag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>nificent
Tudor mansion! It is built of white stone,
its long walls pierced by a multitude of graceful windows
and surmounted by great grouped chimneys
and richly carved and pinnacled gables. Passing
the imposing entrance, we found ourselves in a wide,
grass-grown court, which the mansion surrounds in
quadrangular form. The architecture of the court
is graceful in the extreme&mdash;fluted and carved marble
pilasters running the full height between the windows,
which have a distinctly classic touch on the
entrance side. On the three remaining sides there
are great clustered windows, no less than twenty in
one of the groups, separated by slender stone mullions.
Most of the glass has disappeared or clings
to the casements in shattered fragments, though in
a small, still-inhabited corner the windows are entire.
We wander at will through the once splendid
apartments, now in pitiable decay and ruin. In
the banqueting hall&mdash;a vast apartment with high
open-beamed roof and minstrel gallery&mdash;a washerwoman
is heating her water-pots, and piles of wool
are stored in the Hall of State. But from the far
greater number of the rooms the roof has wholly or
partially disappeared and the rooks scold each
other in the chimneys or caw hungrily among the
sagging rafters. The room once used for the library
is less ruinous and its two immense circular bay windows
overlook a beautiful stretch of country. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
altogether, the house is more of a ruin than we anticipated
at first glance. Restoration would be expensive
and difficult. The walls in many places
lean far from the vertical and are intersected by
cracks and rents. Columns and pilasters are broken
and sprung and in many windows the mullions are
gone or twisted awry. The staircases are gone and
the halls and passageways piled deep with debris.
Yet such is the charm of the place that only recently
an American negotiated with its owner, the Earl of
Winchelsea, with a view to purchase and restoration,
but through inability to clear the title, the deal was
never consummated. Kirby Hall has been in the
possession of the Winchelsea family ever since it
was built by Elizabeth&rsquo;s favorite, Sir Christopher
Hatton, after plans by the master architects, John
Thorpe and Inigo Jones. Reverses compelled its
gradual abandonment, though it was inhabited by
the owner as late as 1830. But we did not inquire
closely into the history of Kirby Hall, nor do we
care to do so. We prefer to think of it as more or
less a mystery&mdash;an enchanted palace whose weird
beauty is not destroyed but only rendered pathetic
by the decay and desolation that has fallen upon it
as it stands alone in the wide stretches of forest-dotted
meadowland.</p>

<p>It was near the end of a strenuous day when
we cast a regretful glance at the great chimneys and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
graceful pinnacles silhouetted against the evening
sky&mdash;but there are no accommodations for travelers
at Kirby Hall. No place near at hand appealed
to us. Coventry and its comfortable King&rsquo;s Head
Hotel was not out of reach and attracted us as it
did more than once in our journeyings. The fifty
miles we covered easily before lamplighting time.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">KIRBY HALL.</p>
</div>

<p>Although we had visited Coventry before&mdash;and,
as it chanced, re-visited it many times later&mdash;we
did not find our interest in the charming old
city lessen, and it occurs to us more than ever as the
best center for Warwickshire. Kenilworth is only
five miles, Warwick twice as far, and Stratford eight
miles farther. At Coventry one may be thoroughly
comfortable, which can hardly be said of the inns
at Warwick or Stratford. Americans always seek
the Red Horse at the latter place because of its associations
with Irving; but there is little more than
the room our gentle traveler occupied, the chair he
sat in and the &ldquo;scepter&rdquo; wherewith he was wont to
stir up a cheerful fire in his grate, to induce one to
return. But in Coventry, at the ancient though much
re-modeled King&rsquo;s Head, one strikes the happy medium
of English hotels. It has the homelikeness and
freedom of the smaller country inns without their
discomforts, and it does not force upon one the painful
formalities of the resort hotels, with their terrible
English table d&rsquo;hote dinners. So when we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
established at the King&rsquo;s Head, in spacious rooms,
with plenty of tables and chairs&mdash;articles uncommon
enough to merit special mention&mdash;there was always
a temptation to linger.</p>

<p>Of the many thousands of Americans who
throng to Stratford every year, perhaps only a small
number are aware that the ancestral homes of the
Washingtons are only a few miles away. Still smaller
is the number who make a pilgrimage to Sulgrave
or to Brington, ten miles farther, though the memories
and traditions of these places are so closely connected
with the ancestors of the Father of His Country.
True, his stately home by the Potomac is not
neglected by his countrymen, but every American
should be deeply interested in the English forefathers
of the man who more than any other freed them
from the &ldquo;rule of kings.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">SULGRAVE CHURCH AND VILLAGE.<br />
Laurence, the ancestor of George Washington, is buried in this church. From Original
Painting by Daniel Sherrin.</p>
</div>

<p>We thought it a favorable omen to see the
gray sky which had drenched Coventry since dawn
break into fleecy clouds as we started over the Banbury
road for Sulgrave. The hedges and trees skirting
the road were washed clean of their coating of
dust and the whole countryside gleamed like an emerald
in the yellow flood of the afternoon sunshine.
Our car seemed to catch the spirit of delight that
pervaded everything and sprang away airily and
noiselessly over the fine highway. Fifteen miles to
the south we turned into a narrow byway leading to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Wormleighton, in whose ancient church there are
records chronicling the marriage of Robert Washington
in 1565 and the birth of his son George in
1608, antedating his famous namesake in America
by more than a century. It would even now be hard
to follow on the map this maze of byroads which we
threaded, winding between the hawthorne hedges
or gliding beneath the over-arching branches of ancient
elms; passing snug farmhouses and cottages
brilliant with rose vines and creepers and fairly embowered
in old-fashioned flowers; and leading
through villages the very embodiment of quiet and
repose. And Sulgrave, the cradle of the Washingtons,
seemed the sleepiest and loneliest of them all&mdash;a
gray, straggling hamlet with only here and there
a dash of color from flower-beds or ivied walls, looking
much as it must have looked when the last Washington
was Lord of the Manor, more than three hundred
years ago. It rather lacks the neat, trim appearance
of the average Midland village. Its streets
are grass-grown and strewn with stones. Many of
the cottages are surrounded by tumble-down stone
walls, and the small church with huge embattled
tower, the product of a recent restoration, crowns
the hill in a wide, uncared-for graveyard.</p>

<p>A little to one side of the village they pointed
out the &ldquo;Washington House,&rdquo; and we followed a
stony path leading into the farmyard, where the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
man was just stabling his horses. A typical country
woman&mdash;of the tenant class&mdash;warmly welcomed us
at Sulgrave Manor. Clearly they are glad to see
Americans here; visitors are not the tolerated intruders
that they are in so many historic places. We
learned that we should even be welcome to a clean,
neatly furnished room had we desired to pass the
night beneath the roof. We were shown every nook
and corner of the curious old house&mdash;not an extensive
or imposing one, but three hundred years ago
domestic accommodations were not elaborate even
in the homes of the nobility, and while the Washingtons
ranked high among the gentry, they did not
possess a title. The house has not been greatly altered,
in outward appearance, at least, and is kept
in scant repair by the owner, a Devonshire gentleman;
fortunately, the thick stone wall and heavy
oaken beams yield but slowly to time&rsquo;s ravages. The
most imposing feature is the solid black-oak staircase
with its curiously twisted banisters. The interior has
been altered from the original plan&mdash;just how much
it is difficult to ascertain. Nothing, however, impresses
the American visitor so much as the Washington
coat-of-arms, executed in plaster on one of
the gables by the ancient owner. This had suffered
much from the weather, but has lately been protected
by a glass covering. The outer walls were originally
covered with plaster, but this has fallen away in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
many places, showing the rough stone underneath;
and elsewhere masses of ivy half hide the small,
square-paned windows. Very faithful in detail and
sentiment is Mr. Sherrin&rsquo;s picture, painted at my
request&mdash;the artist gaining his inspiration by a week
under the old roof while employed in his task. The
picture shows the old house much as we saw it,
standing against a rich sunset sky, its harsh outlines
softened by a little distance. The picture of the
village and church was done by the artist at the
same time, though for effect the church is shown
rather as it appeared before it was restored. We
followed the rough cobblestone walk to the church
door, but could not gain admittance until the caretaker
was found, for Sulgrave Church has been kept
strictly under lock and key ever since one of the
Washington brasses was stolen&mdash;by an American,
of course&mdash;a few years ago. It is a small, rough,
lichen-covered building, much restored, even to the
stolen brass tablet to the memory of the first Laurence
Washington. The engraving of this, on another
page, shows how certainly the Washington
coat-of-arms must have suggested the motif for the
American flag and the great seal of the United
States. The church is very ancient and there is in
the choir a small &ldquo;Lepers&rsquo; Door,&rdquo; unique as one of
three or four in England. Here in olden time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
lepers might approach for alms or to hear the sermon,
but dared not enter the church.</p>

<p class="caption">WASHINGTON BRASS, SULGRAVE CHURCH.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not the purpose of this book of random
wanderings to deal much with sober history, but the
story of Sulgrave&rsquo;s connection with the Washingtons
is not common and a short sketch may not be amiss.
In the reign of Henry VIII., Laurence Washington
was Mayor of Northampton and a gentleman of consequence.
Sulgrave was among the confiscated
church lands that the King was offering at bargain
prices, and Washington purchased it for three hundred
pounds. A tradition that these alienated
church lands would bring evil fortune to the owner
does not seem to have deterred him, though when
his grandson, another Laurence Washington, was
forced by adverse circumstances to sell the estate,
the old superstition might seem to have been verified.
This grandson, with a large family, removed about
1606&mdash;the exact date is doubtful&mdash;to Little Brington,
some ten miles to the northeast of Sulgrave,
where he was given a house, it is thought, by the
Earl of Spencer, to which noble family the Washingtons
were related by marriage. The Laurence
Washington who is buried in Great Brington Church
was the great-great-grandfather of the &ldquo;first American.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later in our wanderings we visited the Bringtons,
which lie only a short distance from Northamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>ton
and may be reached by excellent roads running
through some of the most beautiful Midland country.
We paused in the midst of a heavy shower near the
village cross under the gigantic elm that stands in
front of Great Brington Church, to which we gained
admission with but little delay. The Brington villages
are on the estate of the Spencers, one of the
wealthiest and most ancient families of the English
nobility, and the church is an imposing one, kept in
perfect repair. The chief Washington memorials
are the brasses&mdash;the inscription and coat-of-arms&mdash;over
the grave of Laurence Washington of Sulgrave
and Brington, and these have been sunk deep in the
stone slab and are guarded by lock and key. In
the chapel are some of the most elaborate memorials
we saw&mdash;altar tombs bearing the sculptured effigies
and ancient arms and armor of the Spencers; and
yet how all this splendid state, all the wealth of
carving, arms and effigies, shrink into insignificance
beside the august name on the plain slab in the aisle,
and how all the trappings of heraldry and the chronicles
of all the line of Spencers fade into nothingness
over against that tiny sunken tablet with its stars and
bars!</p>

<p>Half a mile from Great Brington is Little Brington,
where we saw the Washington house referred
to previously, with only a few touches, mullioned
windows and carvings, to distinguish it from the cot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>tages
of the village tenantry. There is a world of
pathos in the inscription cut in the stone tablet above
the doorway, &ldquo;The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh
away. Blessed be the name of the Lord,&rdquo; which
may refer to the loss of Sulgrave and the death
of a young son shortly after the Washingtons reached
Brington. Inside, the house, transformed into a laborer&rsquo;s
cottage, has been altered out of all semblance
to its former self.</p>

<p>But the rain was still coming down in torrents
from the leaden skies and hiding the beauties of the
Bringtons. It took another visit on a perfect August
day to fix the impression which we still retain of the
romantic beauty of the little towns, and it is only
by such a comparison that one can judge how much
we lost on account of the many days of dark, foggy
weather that prevail during the summer in Britain.
Under the more pleasant conditions we could but
feel that, aside from the memories of the Washingtons
which hover over the Bringtons, these delightful
Midland villages might well engage the admiration
of the wayfarer. One may well pause in his
flight through the hawthorne-bordered byways to
view the prospect that greets the eye from Great
Brington churchyard. The church occupies slightly
rising ground, from which in almost every direction
one may behold stretches of some of the most charming
rural country in England; and the church itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
with the old village cross beneath the monster elm
tree, is not the least picturesque feature of the landscape.
The village which fronts it, clean, cozy and
comfortable-looking, its gray walls dashed with ivy
and relieved by the rich color of rose vines and old-time
flowers, is as lovely and peaceful a hamlet as
one will find, even in England. Not less pleasing
is the surrounding country&mdash;&ldquo;pastoral&rdquo; describes it&mdash;with
its long reaches of meadowland, broken by
hedgerows and lordly trees. To the right is Althorpe
House, the stately home of the Spencers,
with its vast, well-kept park, where the huge old
oaks shimmer in the hazy midsummer afternoon.
Amidst all this quiet and beauty one forgets the dark
problems that threaten England and thinks only of
her ineffable charm. Little Brington is not less attractive
than its neighbor&mdash;the thatched structure
above the well in the village green and the two hoary
firs overshadowing it forming a picture as quaint as
pleasing. We leave the lovely villages regretfully,
and winding out of the maze of byroads, take the
highway that leads toward the ancient city of Northampton,
whose chief distinction should be that a
Washington was once its Lord Mayor.</p>

MEANDERINGS FROM COVENTRY TO EXETER</h2>

<p>Despite our numerous visits to Coventry, each
one had some new delight in store; some bit of curious
antiquity that had previously escaped us was
sure to turn up, and once in the heart of the old-world
town, one easily forgets the modern manufacturing
city that has grown up around it. In the immediate
vicinity of the famous three spires there clusters
much to detain one and which may well make
Coventry the shrine of a far greater number of pilgrims
than it now is. If we enter the grand old
church of St. Michael&rsquo;s, whose slender spire rises
three hundred feet into the blue heavens&mdash;for the
heavens are blue and cloudless after the rain of yesterday&mdash;we
shall be confronted by the noblest interior
of any parish church in England. Its unhampered
expanse and lightness of design intensify
its splendid proportions. The fine lancet windows
gleam like clustered jewels, for modern glass of unusually
good taste is intermingled with much dating
from Tudor times, which, fortunately, escaped the
wrath of the fanatics. The old caretaker tells us that
the church is &ldquo;soon to be a cathedral,&rdquo; and if so,
it will wear its distinction fitly indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Near by the church is the guildhall, deservedly
known as one of the finest bits of medieval England
now extant. One may not undertake to catalog its
glories, but its contents, as well as its architecture,
will interest even the layman. In its muniment room
is a collection of eleven thousand books and manuscripts
of great value, and many rare old paintings
grace the walls of the banqueting hall, which has an
unrivaled open-timber roof. In the oriel window at
the head of the stairs, in the softened light of the
antique glass, stands Coventry&rsquo;s patron saint, Lady
Godiva, her shrinking figure beautifully wrought in
white marble. Old arms and armor are scattered
about the halls and the whole atmosphere of the
place is that of three hundred years ago.</p>

<p>To be sure, Elizabeth visited the guildhall.
That rare royal traveler did not neglect the opportunity
for entertainment and display offered her by
her loyal subjects of Coventry. Nor is the tradition
of a certain exchange of compliment between the
men of the old town and their royal mistress without
a touch of realism in its portrayal of the sharp sting
of Elizabeth&rsquo;s wit, not infrequently felt by those who,
knowing her vanity, undertook to flatter her too
grossly. For it is recorded that the citizens of Coventry
greeted her majesty in an address done into
doggerel in this wise:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Wee men of Coventree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are very glad to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yr gracious majestie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Lord, how fair ye bee!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To which she instantly responded:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Our gracious majesty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is very glad to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye men of Coventree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Lord, what fools ye bee!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But we may not linger in Coventry, and after
a hasty glance at the almshouses&mdash;whose brick-and-timber
front, with richly carved black-oak beams,
rivals Leicester&rsquo;s Hospital at Warwick&mdash;we are again
on the King&rsquo;s highway. And it is a highway fit
for a king, this broad sweeping road that leads from
Coventry through Kenilworth and Warwick to Stratford-upon-Avon.
There are few more picturesque
runs in Britain and few that take one past so many
spots of literary and historic interest. Only the fact
that we have been over this route several times before
offers excuse for covering the twenty miles in
less than an hour. As we flit along we catch
glimpses of the fragments of Kenilworth, of Guy&rsquo;s
Cliff, of the old mill; and cautiously thread our way
through the cramped streets of Warwick, which we
leave, not without admiring glances at the Castle,
the splendid tower of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, and the
fine facade of Leicester&rsquo;s Hospital. Passing the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>fines
of the ancient gate, we soon come into the open
road, smooth and gently undulating, and a few minutes
lands us in Shakespeare&rsquo;s Stratford.</p>

<p>It would be hard to follow in sequence our
wanderings from Stratford to Cheltenham, mainly
through country lanes often hidden between tall
hedges and leading over steep, rough hills, as we
sought quaint and historic bits of Worcestershire and
Gloucestershire. Just beyond Shipston-on-Stour we
paused before a Jacobean manor house, a slight opening
in the high hedge permitting a glimpse of the
gray gables and mullioned windows from the road.
A farmer&rsquo;s wife, who saw us stop, called to us and
offered to conduct us through the quaint sixteenth
century building, Little Woolford Manor, as it is
known. The hall, with open-timber roof, paneled
walls and minstrel gallery, lighted by tall windows
still rich with ancient glass, is an apartment to delight
any lover of the old-time domicile. This has
been adapted to a schoolroom and the remainder of
the house divided into farm tenements. It is full
of odd corners and weird passageways and very appropriately
has its ghost, a certain &ldquo;White Ladye,&rdquo;
who walks the scene of her earthly misfortunes at midnight.
None of the occupants had ever seen her
or knew anything of the tradition, but no one could
dispute the good taste of a ghost who should choose
Little Woolford Manor as a residence. Nor could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
such a fine old house properly be without its legend
of Charles the Wanderer, and our guide showed us
a small secret chamber behind an oven where with a
few retainers it is said the king hid and was nearly
roasted by a rousing fire built in the grate by the
pursuing Cromwellians.</p>

<p>There are other traditions and relics of the
royal fugitive in the vicinity, for we passed Little
Compton Manor, plainly visible from the road,
which was once the home of Bishop Juxon, the bosom
friend of King Charles. Here for many years
was preserved the block upon which the King&rsquo;s head
was severed, and also his favorite chair; but these
disappeared shortly after the Bishop&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>A few miles farther, just off the upland road
from Little Compton to Moreton-in-the-Marsh, one
may see the Rollright Stones, a druidical circle; and
tradition declares that these stones were once Danish
invaders who were thus metamorphosed for some
presumptuous act.</p>

<p>Descending a long and dangerously steep hill
sloping from the upland, we came into Chipping
Campden, and, possibly excepting Broadway, it has
hardly an equal in a section famous for picturesque
towns and villages. A wide street between a long
array of gray gables with many time-worn carvings,
odd signs and frequent sun-dials, leads from one
end of the town, marked by a huge oak, to the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
where a giant chestnut stands sentinel. Here again
the almshouses attract attention. They are built of
soft-toned brown stone and the walls are surmounted
by pointed gables and clustered chimneys. Near by
rises the graceful church tower, overshadowing a
building whose vast proportions seem to ill accord
with the decayed little town about it. But we learn
that it was built when Chipping Campden was the
greatest wool market in the country, and a brass
tablet of 1401 commemorates one of the ancient
benefactors of the church as the &ldquo;flower of all wool
merchants in England.&rdquo; We found inside some of
the most perfect brasses that we had seen, but a
general restoration had quite robbed the church of
its greatest charm. The large pillared cross in the
wool market and the massive proportions of the
courthouse, with its heavily buttressed walls, testify
mutely of the time when Chipping Campden was a
place of much greater importance than it is today.</p>

<p>Broadway is already famous. Its &ldquo;discovery&rdquo;
is attributed to Americans, and several American
artists of note&mdash;among them Mr. F. D. Millet, who
occupies the ancient manor house of the Abbot of
Pershore&mdash;have been included in the foreign contingent.
Its name is derived from the broad London
and Worcester road which passes in a long sweeping
curve between rows of fine Tudor and Jacobean
houses with many fanciful gables and massive stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
chimneys. In the coaching days Broadway was of
great importance and then were built the fine inns
and business houses. A period of decadence followed,
during which it gradually sank into a neglected
country village, from which oblivion the old-world
charm of its very decay finally rescued it. It
shows quite markedly the influx of outsiders and
the trail of the tourist; in this regard it is inferior
to the as yet undiscovered and unspoiled town of
Chipping Campden. But while there is a touch of
newness in the outskirts and while the antique buildings
show traces of returning prosperity, there is still
much in Broadway to please the eye and delight
the artistic sense. Few indeed of the old-time inns
have the charm of the Lygon Arms, where we
paused for our afternoon tea. (Afternoon tea&mdash;so
far have the customs of the land of our sojourn corrupted
us!) It is a many-gabled building of soft
sandstone, rich with browns verging into reds and
dashed here and there with masses of ivy which
half hide the deep-set stone-mullioned windows.
To the rear its glass-roofed garage with cement floor
and modern accessories tells plainly of one source of
returning prosperity. Everywhere about the inn is
cleanliness, and the charm of the antique is combined
with modern comfort. The interior is quite
as unspoiled as the outside, and nothing could be
more redolent of old-time England than the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>mense
fireplace in the ingle nook of the hall. Here,
too, linger legends of King Charles, and there is
one great paneled room with huge fireplace and
Tudor furniture that claims the honor of association
with the sterner name of Cromwell. Perhaps the
least pleasing feature of our pilgrimage was the necessity
that often forced us to hasten by places like
the Lygon Arms&mdash;but one could scarce exhaust
Britain&rsquo;s attractions in a lifetime should he pause as
long and as often as he might wish.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">LYGON ARMS, BROADWAY.</p>
</div>

<p>Evesham we passed in the rain and gathering
twilight. We reached Tewkesbury at nightfall, but
its inns did not strike our fancy, and we hastened to
Cheltenham, leaving the fine old towns for a later
visit. At the Victoria in Cheltenham we found
things much more to our liking.</p>

<p>We followed a main road almost due south
from Cheltenham through Painswick, Stroud and
Nailsworth, gray old towns lying deep in the hills.
At Painswick is a fine Perpendicular church, so
much restored as to present a rather new appearance.
The churchyard has a wonderful array of carefully
clipped yew trees, perhaps a hundred in all, though
no one, says local tradition, can count them twice
the same&mdash;a peculiarity also ascribed to the monoliths
at Stonehenge. Close to the church walls are
the ancient stocks, in this case forged from heavy
iron bars and presenting an air of staunch security<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
that must have struck terror to the hearts of old-time
culprits; and the rough stone slab upon which
the offenders were seated still remains in place.</p>

<p>Stroud is a larger and better-appearing town,
whose ten thousand inhabitants depend mainly upon
the manufacture of English broadcloths. The whole
section, in fact, was once the center of cloth manufacture,
but the advent of the steam engine and more
modern methods superseded the watermills. All
about are half-ruined factory buildings, some of them
once of vast extent, with shattered windows and
sagging roofs. Here and there one has survived in
a small way or has been adapted to some other industry.
In the neighborhood are many country
houses, once the residences of wealthy cloth-makers,
but now either deserted or turned into farm tenements.</p>

<p>The country is hilly and wooded, and we had
few points of vantage that afforded views more picturesque
and far-reaching than from some of the upland
roads overlooking these Gloucestershire landscapes.
The road sweeps around the hills, rising at times
far above the valleys, affording a panorama of the
Avon gleaming through the dense green foliage that
half conceals it. The vale presents the most charming
characteristics of rural England. One sees the
irregular patchwork of the little fields, the great parks
with their sunny meadowlands and groups of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>cient
trees, the villages lying in the valleys or clinging
to the hillsides, and the gray church towers that
lend a touch of majesty and solemn sentiment to almost
every glimpse of Britain.</p>

<p>We missed the main road from Bath to Wells,
wandering through a maze of unmarked byroads,
and were able to proceed only by frequent inquiry.
We did not regain the highway until just entering
the town and had been a comparatively long time
in going a short distance. After a few minutes&rsquo;
pause to admire the marvelous west front of the cathedral,
with its endless array of crumbling prophets,
saints and kings, weatherworn to a soft-gray blur,
we were away on the highroad leading across the
wold to Cheddar, famed for its stupendous cliffs,
its caverns&mdash;and its cheese. The caverns and cliffs
are there, but little cheese now comes from Cheddar,
even though it bears the name. As we ascended the
exceedingly steep and winding road we were astonished&mdash;overwhelmed.
We had not expected to find
natural scenery upon such an amazing scale in the
heart of England&mdash;gray pinnacled cliffs rising, almost
sheer, five hundred feet into the sky. Not often
may British scenery be styled imposing, but the
towering cliffs of Cheddar surely merit such description.
In the midst of the gorge between the great
cliffs there are two prehistoric caverns extending far
into the earth. We entered one of them, now a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
mere passageway, now a spacious cavern whose
domelike roof glistens with translucent stalactites.
Here we pass a still, mirrorlike pool, and there a
deep fissure from which comes the gurgle of a subterranean
river. Altogether, there is much that is
interesting and impressive. Perhaps it all seems a
little gaudy and unnatural because of the advertising
methods and specious claims of the owner and
alleged discoverer, but none the less a visit is worth
while. The museum of relics found in the cavern
contains a remarkable prehistoric skull, with low,
thick frontal bone and heavy square jaw, but its
queerest feature is little spurlike projections of the
temporal bone just above the ear. It is estimated by
archaeologists that the possessor of this curious skull
had lived at least forty thousand years ago and mayhap
had made his dwelling-place in the Cheddar
Caves. We were assured that an offer from the
British Museum of five thousand pounds for the relic
had been refused.</p>

<p>The sun was low when we left Cheddar, and
Taunton seemed the nearest place where we might
be sure of good accommodations. We soon reached
Axbridge, a gray little market town, so ancient that
a hunting-lodge built by King John still stands on
the market square. Near Bridgewater, a few miles
farther, is the Isle of Athelney&mdash;once an island in a
marsh, perhaps&mdash;where King Alfred made his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
desperate stand against the Danish invaders, defeating
them and finally expelling them from Britain.
Not less in interest, though perhaps less important in
its issues, was the Battle of Sedgemoor, fought here
in 1685, when the Duke of Monmouth was disastrously
defeated by the Royal Army&mdash;the last battle
worthy of the name to be waged on English soil.</p>

<p>But we were to learn more of Monmouth at
Taunton and to have again impressed upon us how
easy it is in Britain for one to hasten through places
of the deepest historic interest quite unaware of their
tragic story. We had passed through Taunton before,
seeing little but a staid old country town with
a church tower of unmatched gracefulness and dignified
proportions; but Taunton&rsquo;s tragic part in the
parliamentary wars and her fatal connection with
&ldquo;King Monmouth&rdquo; never occurred to us, if, indeed,
we knew of it at all. Taunton was strongly for
the Parliament, but it was a storm center and was
taken and retaken until the iron hand of Fairfax
crushed the Royalists before its walls. Its record
stood against it when the King &ldquo;came into his own
again.&rdquo; Its walls were leveled to the ground, its
charter taken away and many of its citizens thrown
into prison. Discontent and hatred of the Stuarts
were so rampant that any movement against their
rule was welcomed by the Taunton Whigs, though
it is hard to see any consistency in the unreasoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
support they gave to the Duke of Monmouth&mdash;the
son of Charles II. and one of his many mistresses&mdash;in
his pretensions to the throne occupied by James
II. Monmouth entered Taunton amidst the wildest
acclamations, and it was from the market square of
the rebellious town that he issued his proclamation
assuming the title of King. He was followed by an
ill-organized and poorly equipped army of seven
thousand men, who were defeated by four thousand
Royal Troops. Then followed a reign of terror in
Taunton. The commander of the King&rsquo;s forces
hanged, without pretense of trial, many of his prisoners,
using the sign of the old White Hart Inn as a
gallows. Then came the Bloody Assizes, held by
Jeffreys of infamous memory, in the great hall of the
castle. After trials no more than travesties of brutal
jests and savage cruelty, more than three hundred
Somersetshire men were sentenced, according to the
terrible customs of the time, to be &ldquo;hanged, drawn
and quartered,&rdquo; and a thousand were doomed to
transportation. Here the active history of Taunton
may be said to have ended.</p>

<p>But Taunton has little to remind us of these
dark and bloody times as we glide through her fine
old streets and draw up in front of the London
Hotel, where the host himself in evening dress welcomes
us at the door. Every attention is given us
and The London certainly deserves its official ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>pointment
by the Royal Automobile Club as well
as the double distinction accorded it by the infallible
Baedeker. It is one of the charming old-fashioned
inns, such as perhaps inspired the poet Shenstone
with the sentiment expressed in his well-known
quatrain:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Whoe&rsquo;er has traveled life&rsquo;s dull round,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whate&rsquo;er his stages may have been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May sigh to think that he has found<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His warmest welcome at an inn.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Modern Taunton is a city of some twenty
thousand people, and being the county town, with
some manufactories, it enjoys a quiet prosperity. Of
its ancient landmarks, the castle, dating from the
eleventh century, is the most notable and has appropriately
been turned into a museum. Here one
may enter the hall where Jeffreys held his court.
Though two centuries or more have elapsed, the
&ldquo;horror of blood&rdquo; seems still to linger in the gloomy
apartment. The market-place retains its old-time
characteristics, and though the house occupied by
Jeffreys has disappeared, the White Hart Inn still
stands. But the glory of Taunton is St. Mary&rsquo;s
Church, one of the most graceful examples of the
Perpendicular period in England. The splendid
tower seems almost frail in its airy lightness&mdash;and
perhaps it is, for it is a recent restoration, or rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
replacement, of the older one, which had become
insecure.</p>

<p>Sherborne Abbey we had missed in our former
wanderings, though once very near it, and we felt
that we must make amends though it cost us a detour
of sixty miles. And yet, what hardship is it to go
out of one&rsquo;s way in Britain? Indeed, can one ever
go out of his way in rural England? Scarcely, from
the point of view of such nomads as ourselves.</p>

<p>The great tower of Curry Rivell Church dominates
in such a lordly manner the village straggling
up the hill toward it that we were tempted to look
inside, and a mild curiosity was aroused, from which
we have never yet been able to rid ourselves. For,
chained to one of the iron railings of a sixteenth
century tomb, is a queer little iron-bound oaken cabinet.
It is scarcely more than a foot in length, the
wood is worm-eaten and the massive lock and heavy
hinges are red with rust. What mystery does it
contain and why did it escape the church-looters of
Puritan times? The church is rich in antique carvings,
among them a delicately wrought screen and
fine fifteenth century bench ends. The tomb to
which the coffer is chained is a very unusual one.
It bears on its altar the effigies of two mail-clad warriors,
while at either side kneel figures of their wives
over two tiny cribs with several gnomelike children
tucked in each. Overhead, borne by four pillars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
is a domed canopy upon which are painted four
sprawling cherubs. All very quaint and strange and
illustrative of the queer mortuary ideas of the medieval
period.</p>

<p>We followed the winding, hilly and often indifferent
road that leads through Somerton, Ilchester
and Yeovil to Sherborne, and while our lunch was
preparing at the slow-moving Antelope&mdash;there is
little in a name, in this instance&mdash;we wandered down
old-world streets to the abbey, the goal of all pilgrims
to Sherborne. It seemed odd to find the old
town crowded with rural visitors all agape at a
fantastic circus parade that was winding along the
crooked streets, but Sherborne is fond of parades and
pageants, for we were assured that the historical
pageant now the rage in the older towns of England
was originated in Sherborne. The town itself is a
charming place&mdash;I borrow the words of an enthusiastic
admirer whose picture may be better than I
can paint:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a bright town, prim and old-fashioned,
and unsullied by the aggressive villas and red brick
terraces of the modern suburb. Although a small
place, it is yet of much dignity. Here are timber-faced
dwellings, where the upper story overhangs
the lower, and where the roof breaks out into irrelevant
gables; houses with the stone-mullioned casements
of Tudor days or the round bow window of
the Georgian period; houses with gateways under
them leading into courtyards; humble buildings fashioned
out of stone filched from a church; cottages
with the arched doorways of a convent or with buttresses
worthy of a chapel; pieces of old wall and
other miscellaneous fragments which the town with
its love for the past has never had the heart to cast
aside. Over the grey roofs can be seen the trees
upon the hilltop, while over many a crumbling wall
comes the fragrance of garden or orchard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as we rounded a corner and came upon a
full view of the abbey church, we felt that it had
rightly been styled the &ldquo;glory of Sherborne.&rdquo; Perhaps
its low tower gives an impression of incompleteness
and lack of proportion&mdash;but it seemed to accentuate
the mighty proportions of the church itself and
it was with a feeling almost verging upon awe that
we entered the majestic portals. And we learned
it as we know only few historic churches in England,
for the gem of all vergers is at Sherborne. To
him his work is a labor of love, not the usual perfunctory
performance in hope of a fee. He had
made discoveries of importance himself in whiling
away his time in the abbey and had located and uncovered
an ancient effigy that had been inconsiderately
built into the walls in earlier days. He told
us of the checkered history of the abbey, of the wars
of the monks and citizens, as a result of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
church suffered from a great fire, the marks of which
still remain in the red stains on the soft yellow stone,
of the Dissolution and the cavalier manner in which
Henry the Wrecker bestowed the abbey on one of
his friends, who in turn sold it to the parish for
two hundred and fifty pounds&mdash;all of which would
be too long to record in detail in this crowded chronicle.
But the interior of Sherborne Abbey&mdash;where
is there another like it? Not in all England; probably
not in the world. It lacks the &ldquo;dim religious
light&rdquo; that pervades, like a soft-toned mist, most of
the great church buildings; the windows flood the
yellow stone with many-colored beams and lighten
the splendors of the golden fan vault with its rich
bosses and heraldic devices until every detail comes
out clearly to the beholder below.</p>

<p>But we are lingering too long at the abbey;
we were to return to the Antelope in half an hour,
and thrice that period has elapsed. We hie back
to our inn and do not complain of our cold repast.
&ldquo;It is ten minutes&rsquo; walk to the castle,&rdquo; said our host.
Then why take the car? A ten minutes&rsquo; walk will
give us a little of the exercise we need. We start
under the sweltering sun&mdash;it is a hot day, even as
we reckon it&mdash;and follow the crooked streets. Here
is a high wall&mdash;it must be the castle. No, the castle
is farther on; and we repeat the wearisome experience
until half an hour has elapsed and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
are only at the entrance gate of the park. We are
almost exhausted, for our long tramp on the &ldquo;abbey
stones&rdquo; did not especially invigorate us, but we will
go on after having come so far.</p>

<p>It was hardly worth while&mdash;Cromwell had left
very little of Sherborne Castle. It seemed melancholy,
indeed, that the riddled gateway and the
straggling pieces of wall should be all that remains
of such a lordly building. We were interested to
know that it had been granted to Sir Walter Raleigh
&ldquo;forever&rdquo; in 1597&mdash;but only six years later the
knightly founder of Virginia was indicted for treason
and fell a victim to the cowardly malice of King
James, and Sherborne Castle reverted to the crown.
It was less than half a century later that Fairfax received
its surrender in the name of the Parliament,
and when the gunpowder mines were fired the active
days of the fortress were at an end.</p>

<p>We retrace our steps to the Antelope, thinking
mournfully of the car, which would have made such
short and easy work of our weary trip, and we
heave a sigh of relief when once more, having
donned our &ldquo;seven-league boots,&rdquo; we hear the soft
purr of the motor and enjoy the rush of the cool,
sweet air&mdash;after our &ldquo;ten minutes&rsquo; walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It grows late and Exeter is far away, but we
are sure of comfort at the Rougemont and we give
the car rein. How she sweeps over the sunset hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and glides along the cool valleys, pausing cautiously
to pass some rose-embowered village, now gathering
speed again for another rush over the fine road!
She is ahead of schedule at Honiton, and one of our
party remembers that the Honiton lace is famous.
It is an expensive bit of recollection, but all things
go in a motor tour. After a half-hour&rsquo;s pause, we
are away again, and before long catch sight of the
huge bulk of Exeter Cathedral looming above the
old city against the twilight sky.</p>

RAMBLES IN THE WEST COUNTRY</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Through the heart of Dartmoor forest&rdquo; may
bring up many fascinating, even weird associations,
but on our map we regarded the thin red line of our
road rather dubiously. It runs almost straight from
Exeter to Prince Town&mdash;the prison town of the
moor&mdash;and on either side for many miles lies a
waste country, apparently quite devoid of villages
and even of roads. The road as shown on the map
is thickly studded with arrow heads, denoting dangerous
hills, and the description in the road-book is
far from alluring. But we were not to be deterred
from exploring Dartmoor, as we had been on a
previous occasion, though indeed we found the first
few miles between Exeter and Moreton Hampstead
trying and almost terrifying in places. The hills offered
little impediment to our motor, but for all
that one has a rather eery feeling when clinging to
a precipitous incline. If something should let loose!
But nothing did.</p>

<p>Moreton Hampstead is a bleak, lonely little
town set well into the western edge of the moor and
surrounded by rugged tors on every hand. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
without a bit of antiquity, for it has a sixteenth century
building, called the Arcade, whose Moorish
touches are decidedly picturesque. It is like a bit
of Spain in the hills of Dartmoor and seems strangely
out of place. Only three miles from Moreton
Hampstead, lying in a secluded valley, is Chagford,
famous for its quaint old inn and wild surroundings.</p>

<p>Once out of Moreton Hampstead and away
on the yellow highway that bisects the moor, we
found ourselves in a country as barren as any we
had seen in England. The road, though winding
and steep, is generally visible for some distance ahead,
and we found little hindrance to a swift, steady flight
that carried us over the long hills far more quickly
than we anticipated. The day, which had begun in
mist and rain, became lighter and a rapidly clearing
sky gave us the opportunity of seeing the wild
beauty of the moor at its best. Despite its loneliness
and cheerlessness, there was a wonderful play of
color: the reds and browns of the broken granite,
the purple blaze of the heather, the vivid yellow of
the gorse and the metallic green of the whortle, all
intensified by golden sunshine, have marvelously
transformed the somber tone of the moorland of scarce
an hour before. But where is the &ldquo;forest&rdquo;? Only
stunted trees appear here and there, or a fringe of
woods along the clear streams; we learn that
&ldquo;forest&rdquo; once meant a waste, uncultivated tract of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
land, and in later days has been applied to woodlands
alone. We run for miles with no human habitation
in sight save an occasional cottage in a
small, barren field surrounded by stone walls. We
come upon a large, attractive-looking inn unexpectedly&mdash;though
it ought not to be unexpected to find
an inn anywhere in England&mdash;the Two Bridges,
situated near the head waters of the Dart, here no
more than a brawling streamlet. We leave the car
by the roadside and enter the homelike hall, where
an array of fishing-tackle makes clear the excuse for
this pleasant hotel in the moor. The day has been
chilly and, strange to say, a fire flickers in the grate.
We are just in time for luncheon and a goodly number
of guests respond to the vigorous beating of the
gong&mdash;that almost universal abomination of the provincial
English hotel. It appears that the quiet and
seclusion of Dartmoor is not without its attractions
to many people. We ourselves leave the pleasant
inn with regret; we should have liked a day&rsquo;s rest
in the cozy ingle-nook.</p>

<p>The walls and battlements of Prince Town
Prison soon loom in sight. This was established in
1800 as a military prison for French soldiers, and a
few Americans were confined here in 1812. It
then fell into disuse until 1850, but for the half-century
since it has served its present purpose as a penal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
institution and has been greatly added to from time
to time.</p>

<p>An English writer says: &ldquo;Dartmoor is so huge
that one must be born and spend a lifetime near
it to really know it, and the visitor can merely endeavour
to see typical examples of its granite tors,
its peaty streams, its great stretches of boulder-strewn
heather, and its isolated villages.&rdquo; Evidently
he must mean that it is huge in its mysteries
and its moods, for it is really only fourteen by twenty-two
miles&mdash;perhaps half as large as the average
county in the United States.</p>

<p>At Tavistock we are well beyond the confines
of the moor and follow a fine road to Launceston,
where we glance at the huge circular keep of the
castle and look longingly at the White Hart, which
recalls only pleasant memories. But we are bound
for an enchanted land and, like many a gallant
knight of yore, we would hasten past &ldquo;many-towered
Camelot&rdquo; to the castle of the blameless king.
The declining sun, toward which we rapidly course,
seems to flash across the Cornish hills the roselight
of the old Arthurian romance, and the stately measures
of the &ldquo;Idyls of the King&rdquo; come unbidden to
our minds. But we soon have something less romantic
to think of, for in attempting a short cut to
Tintagel without going to Camelford, we run into a
series of the crookedest, roughest lanes we found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
all England. These appear to have been quite
abandoned; in places mere ravines with myriads of
sharp loose stones and many long steep hills. But
we push on and almost ere we are aware, find ourselves
in Tintagel village, which with its long rows of
boarding-houses hardly accords with one&rsquo;s preconceived
romantic notions. Then we catch a glimpse
of the ocean out beyond the headland, upon which
is perched a huge, square-towered building&mdash;King
Arthur&rsquo;s Castle Hotel, they tell us&mdash;and thither we
hasten. This hotel, only recently completed, is
built on a most liberal scale, though it can hardly accommodate
many guests at a time. The public
rooms are most elaborately furnished and of enormous
size. The great round table in the reading
room is a replica of the original at Shrewsbury, at
which, declares tradition, King Arthur sat with his
fifty knights. The guest rooms are on an equally
generous scale and so arranged that every one fronts
on the sea. The rates are not low by any means,
yet it is hard to conceive how such a hotel can be a
paying investment.</p>

<p>After we reached the hotel, the long twilight
still gave time to contemplate the weird beauty of
the surroundings and to explore the ruins of the castle
so famed in song and story. We scrambled down
the high headland, upon which the hotel stands,
to the level of the blue inlet of the sea, depicted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
such a masterly manner in the painting by Mr.
Moran, the towering cliffs crowned by the fragmentary
ruins looming far above us. A path cut
in the edge of the cliff leads to a precarious-looking
foot-bridge across the chasm and a still narrower
and steeper path hugs the face of the precipice on
the opposite side until a heavy oaken door is reached.
This door, to which the old caretaker in the cottage
below had given me the key, opens into the supposed
site of King Arthur&rsquo;s castle. Only a few
scattered bits of masonry remain and these are probably
of a later time than that of the early Briton.</p>

<p class="caption">KING ARTHUR&rsquo;S CASTLE, OFF TINTAGEL HEAD, CORNWALL.<br />
From Original Painting by Thos. Moran, N. A.</p>
</div>

<p>The spot is lonely and quite barren save a few
patches of greensward upon which were peacefully
grazing a flock of sheep&mdash;one finds them everywhere
in Britain. I was quite alone&mdash;there were
no other visitors at that late hour and my companions
had given up the dizzy ascent before it was
fairly begun&mdash;and I strove to reconstruct in imagination
the castle as it stood in the days of the blameless
king. How the wild old stories crowded upon
me in that lonely twilight hour! Here, legend declares&mdash;and
I care not if it be dim indeed and questioned
by the wiseacres&mdash;was once the court of the
wise and faultless Arthur, who gathered to himself
the flower of knighthood of Christendom and was
invincible to all attacks from without, but whose
dominion crumbled away before the faithlessness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
dishonor of his own followers. Here, perchance,
the faithless Guinevere pined and sighed for her forsworn
lover and gazed on the sea, calm and radiant
as it is even now, or saw it lash itself into unspeakable
fury upon the frowning bastions of the coast.
But, alas! how dim and uncertain is all that is left,
and how the tales vary save that they all center in
the king! Little remains in local tradition of all the
vanished splendors of those ancient days save that
the king did not die; that in the form of a chough
he haunts the scenes of his glory and his downfall,
and that he will come again&mdash;</p>

<p>But I am quite forgetting the flight of time, and
with a lingering look at the storied spot, I slowly
descend. Then I climb to the more extensive ruin
on the landward side, much shattered but grim and
massive in decay. There must have been a connection
between the castles on either side of the great
ravine, though it is hardly apparent how this could
have been. Perhaps the gap has widened much in
the long course of time. It is dusk when we return
to the hotel and sit long on the open terrace fronting
the sea, contemplating the beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>Never have I beheld a more glorious sunset
than that which lightened the wild Cornish coast
and ocean on that particular evening. A dark band
of cloud lay low along the western horizon, with a
clear, opalescent sky above, and below a thin strip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of lucent gold with silvery clouds floating in it like
fairy ships. Suddenly the sun dropped from behind
the cloud, which had obscured his full splendor,
into the resplendent zone beneath, flooding the sea,
into which he slowly sank, with a marvelous though
evanescent glory. Then followed all the indescribable
color changes and combinations, which varied
momentarily until they faded into the dusky hues
of a moonlit night. It marked the close of a perfect
day&mdash;clear and cool, with sky of untainted blue and
ocean as still and glassy as a quiet inland lake.</p>

<p>Not less inspiring was the scene that greeted us
through our open lattices in the morning&mdash;a sea steely
blue in the distance, rippling into bars of frosted silver
near the shore, while the stern outlines of the
headlands were softened by a clinging blue haze.
We lingered on the legend-haunted ground until
nearly noon and it was with keen regret that we
glided away from the pleasant hostelry back to the
village and past the old church on the headland,
whose bells tolled without mortal hands on the far-off
day when the body of King Arthur was borne
away to sepulture in Glastonbury Abbey.</p>

<p>A fine upland road led us nearly due north
from Camelford through long stretches of moorland&mdash;or
country almost as sterile as the moors&mdash;diversified
with great patches of gorse and scattered groups
of stunted trees. We encountered scarcely a village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
for a distance of twenty-five miles, for we did not
turn aside for Bude or for Stratton, just opposite on
each side of the road. The latter is said to be one
of the most unspoiled and genuinely ancient of the
smaller Cornish villages. At times we were within
a mile or two of the ocean and caught fugitive
glimpses of blue expanses of quiet sea. Then the
road sweeps farther inland and the country improves
in appearance, though it is still Cornwall and Devon
and far different from the sleek, prosperous beauty
of the Midlands.</p>

<p class="caption">OFF THE COAST OF DEVON.<br />
From Original Painting by A. J. Warne-Browne.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The most exquisite town in England,&rdquo; writes
an enthusiast of Clovelly, but Clovelly&rsquo;s very quaintness
has made it so widely known that it hardly
has a place in a chronicle that seeks rather the untrodden
ways. It is not possible for a motor or
any other vehicle to descend the steep, stone-paved
streets, and about a quarter of a mile above
the town we left the car in an exceedingly prosperous-looking
stable-yard filled to overflowing with
motors, carriages and chars-a-bancs.</p>

<p>Clovelly well deserves its reputation for the picturesque
qualities that have transformed it from an
unpretentious fishing village, lost among the clifflike
hills, into a thronged tourist resort. Fortunately, as
yet there has been no attempt to modernize; no
stucco-and-timber hotel detracts from the antique
flavor; the people who come to Clovelly do not as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
a rule stay long. Large excursion steamers, usually
crowded, ply from Ilfracombe, and coaches and
chars-a-bancs from Hartland and Barnstaple bring
troops of visitors. Coaching parties come from Tintagel
(round trip eighty miles) and one is sure to
find Clovelly crowded in season, especially if the
day is fine. And so we found it, literally thronged,
a huge excursion steamer lying at anchor in the harbor.
There was a little disarray and confusion at
the pleasant New Inn&mdash;new in name only&mdash;evidently
due to more patronage than could easily be taken
care of. As we waited for luncheon we looked
about at the collection of antique brass, copper,
china and pottery that almost covered the walls and
crowded the mantelpieces and odd corners about the
inn. We were told that the landlady is a famous
collector and that many of the pieces are rare and
valuable. A more amusing if not less interesting
feature of the house is the sentiment expressed in
halting doggerel, emblazoned in large red letters on
the walls and ceiling of the dining-room. It is good
only from the standpoint of exceeding badness, and
its general tenor is to flatter Americans, who no
doubt constitute a large proportion of the guests.</p>

<p>The old, time-worn churches of England are
past numbering and they came to have an almost
weird fascination for us. The tombs, ranging from
the artistic to the ghastly or grotesque, the old stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
with their often queer or even ridiculous epitaphs,
the sculptures, the bosses, the frescoes, the stained
windows, the gargoyles and the oftentimes strange
history or still stranger legends connected with nearly
every one&mdash;but why prolong the list of curious attractions
of these ancient fanes, often quite peculiar
in each case? Just before we entered Barnstaple we
turned into a byroad, and dropping down a hill of
appalling steepness and length, came to Tawstock
Church, famed as the finest country church in Devon&mdash;the
&ldquo;Westminster of the West Country,&rdquo; some
enthusiast has styled it. Though hardly deserving
such a dignified characterization as this, Tawstock
Church is well worth a visit. Besides some remarkable
tombs and fine Elizabethan pews, it has a peculiar
gallery curiously wrought in vine and leaf pattern
from black oak, and now used by the bell-ringers
to reach the tower. Tawstock Mansion,
near by, appears rather modern&mdash;a large building
shining in a fresh coat of yellow paint that gave it
much the appearance of a summer hotel. The
house and church are located in a deep wooded
valley and the towers of the ancient gateway lend
a touch of much-needed antiquity to the scene.</p>

<p class="caption">TAWSTOCK CHURCH, DEVONSHIRE.</p>
</div>

<p>Barnstaple, like Bideford, while a very old
town, has few old-time relics now left. It has become
a manufacturing town, its chief product being
Barum ware, an inexpensive grade of pottery. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Golden Lion Inn, once a residence of the Earl of
Bath, is famed as a place of solid comfort, and still
retains much of the gorgeous decorations done by
its former occupant. The poet Shelley had an odd
association with Barnstaple. When living at Lynton,
after his marriage with Harriet Westbrook, he
came to Barnstaple and spent some time in bringing
out a pamphlet scurrilously attacking the chief justice
who had sentenced to prison the publisher of
the works of Thomas Paine. One of the poet&rsquo;s associates,
who distributed the pamphlets, was sentenced
to six months in jail, and Shelley narrowly
escaped by hastily leaving the town.</p>

<p>The road from Bideford through Barnstaple
and Ilfracombe is rather uninteresting, save the last
few miles, which pass through wooded hills and
along deep verdant valleys. Ilfracombe is a resort
town, pure and simple, and we found few hotels
on a grander scale than the Ilfracombe, standing
in beautiful grounds facing the sea, which murmured
almost directly beneath our open windows. It was
a beautiful evening; the tide was just receding from
the jutting rocks scattered along the coast, whereon
the sea, even in its mildest moods, chafes into foam;
and one can easily imagine a most awe-inspiring
scene when the angry ocean, driven by a westerly
wind, assails these bold, angular rocks. After having
visited every resort town of note in England, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
recollection is that of all, Ilfracombe is the most
strikingly situated; nor do any of them command
views of a coast line more rugged and picturesque.</p>

<p>The rain was falling heavily when we came to
Dunster on the following day and the abbey church
was gloomy indeed. And what can be gloomier
than an old church on a gray day, when the rain
pours from the low-hung clouds and sweeps in fitful
gusts against the mossy gravestones and crumbling,
ivy-clad walls? A scene that renders one solemn
and thoughtful on almost any occasion becomes positively
depressing under such conditions. And
though we recall Dunster Church with associations
not unpleasing in perspective, the surroundings were
not altogether pleasing at the time. We found the
caretaker, a bent old woman, in the church, but she
informed us that there were really two churches and
that she had jurisdiction over only one of them.
However, she conducted us about the dimly lighted
building, gloomy indeed from the lowering skies
without, and our recollection of her story of the
quarrel that resulted in the partition of the church
has faded quite away. But we do remember the
rood screen which has fourteen separate openings,
no two wrought in the same pattern and altogether
as marvelous a piece of black-oak carving as we saw
in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Aside from the abbey church, there are other
things of interest in Dunster, especially the market
cross and the castle. The latter overlooks the town
from a neighboring hill and is one of the lordliest fortresses
in the West Country. The town lies in one
of the loveliest vales in Somersetshire and is famed
for its beautiful surroundings. This section of Somerset
and Devon is rich in literary associations; at
Nether Stowey we pass the square, uncomfortable-looking
house, close to the roadside, where Coleridge
lived for three years, beginning in 1797. Indeed,
it was in the autumn of that year that he made
the excursion with Wordsworth and Dorothy, during
which the plan of the &ldquo;Ancient Mariner&rdquo; was
conceived. A few months before, while in a lonely
farmhouse between Porlock and Lynton, he had the
dream which he started to record in &ldquo;Kubla Khan.&rdquo;
This poem he had composed in his dream, but while
writing it down on awakening, a &ldquo;person from Porlock&rdquo;
interrupted, and when the poet essayed to
write, not only the words but the images of the
vision had faded away, and the fragment of &ldquo;Kubla
Khan&rdquo; remains like a shattered gem. Wordsworth
and his sister Dorothy came a little later to Alfoxden
House, standing in a pleasant park in the parish of
Halford, and here the literary association between
Coleridge and Wordsworth became intimate and the
little volume of &ldquo;Lyrical Ballads&rdquo; was published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
jointly by them in 1798. Southey, while storm-stayed
by &ldquo;an unwelcome summer rain&rdquo; at the Ship
Inn in Porlock, wrote a sonnet in praise of the hills
and glens. Hazlitt and Charles Lamb at times
joined their friends here for pedestrian excursions
among the hills. Nor can we forget Blackmore,
whose &ldquo;Lorna Doone&rdquo; turned the eyes of the English-speaking
world toward the Exmoor wastes.
Shelley&rsquo;s escapade at Barnstaple we have already
mentioned and the cottage he occupied at Lynton
still stands. No doubt much of the weird beauty
that pervades his work entered his soul amidst the
glorious surroundings&mdash;the sea, the hills and the
vales&mdash;of the West Country.</p>

From Original Painting by A. J. Warne-Browne.</p>
</div>

<p>A pause at Cleeve Abbey near at hand gave
us perhaps a better idea of the life of monastic days
than any other we visited&mdash;and we saw all the greater
abbeys of Britain. In the majority of cases the
abbey proper had been destroyed, but the church
escaped, often through purchase by the citizens. At
Cleeve the reverse has happened; the church has
totally disappeared, but the abbey buildings are nearly
intact. As a well-informed writer puts it:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole life of the society can be lived
over again with but little demands on the imagination.
We can see the dormitories in which they
slept, the refectory where they fed, the abbot&rsquo;s particular
parlour and the room for accounts, the kitchen,
and even the archway through which their bodies
went out to the grave. The church suffered from
despoilers more than any other part of the abbey, and
great is the loss to architecture. Otherwise we get
a community of the Middle Ages preserved in all
its essential surroundings, the refectory being in particular
a grand fifteenth-century hall.&rdquo; The ceiling
of this great apartment is of the hammer-beam pattern,
the beams richly carved, and, springing from
oaken corbels, figures of angels with expanded wings.</p>

<p>It brings one near indeed to the spirit of monastic
days&mdash;this gray old ruin, through which sweep
the wind and rain and where under foot the grass
grows lush and green as it grows only in England&mdash;the
spirit which the Latin legend over the
gatehouse so vividly expresses, quaintly rendered
thus:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Gate Open be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To honest folk as free.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And the gray-whiskered custodian, so rheumatic and
feeble that his daughter, a husky peasant woman,
guides visitors about the abbey, warmed up to us
as we were about to leave and opened his heart
about the ruin in which he dwelt and which he
seemed to love. He told us its story in the broad
West Country dialect and pointed out to us many
things of curious interest that we otherwise should
have overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The sky is clearing; the low sun flashes along
the hill-crests and floods the Somerset landscape with
ethereal beauty, which we drink in as we skim
swiftly along the smooth, wet road. We catch a
final gleam of the ocean at Weston-super-Mare
and pass a long row of imposing hotels. Then we
are away for Bristol, the Queen City of the West
Country.</p>

ODD CORNERS OF THE WELSH BORDER</h2>

<p>There are few English castles where the spirit
of medievalism lingers as at Berkeley and few that
have darker deeds recorded in their long annals of
crime. It has had a strange fascination for me ever
since I read its story in my boyhood days, and the
verse of the poet Gray had given the castle a weird
association in my mind:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Mark the year and mark the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Severn shall echo with affright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When shrieks of death through Berkeley&rsquo;s roofs shall ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrieks of an agonizing king.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was therefore a keen disappointment to
learn on arriving in the quiet Gloucestershire town
that it was not a day when the castle was open to
visitors. However, we do not regret this so much
in retrospect. The castle, grim, many-towered, ivy-clad,
the very embodiment of the days of chivalry,
still lingers in memory, with nothing to disenchant
its mystery and romance. The old keeper at the imposing
entrance was evidently sincere in his regret
that the rule might not be suspended for our bene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>fit&mdash;for
indeed we had found such regulations not
as the laws of the Medes and Persians, but there
was no such good fortune here. &ldquo;But do not fail,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;to view the castle from the meadows, for
no finer sight will you find in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If there be finer views of other English castles&mdash;a
mere matter of opinion, after all&mdash;there can hardly
be a better viewpoint than the Berkeley Meadows.
It is a wide expanse of lawnlike meadowland
lying alongside the castle, which stretches out its
battlemented and turreted length against a background
of majestic trees; from these rises the square
church-tower in stern outline against the bluest of
English June skies. The scene indeed savors more
of enchantment than reality, and the environment
seems fitting to the historic pile where a king was
done to death and which Shakespeare mentions more
than once. The present owner is the twenty-seventh
in direct descent from Robert Fitzhardinge, to whom
the manor was originally granted and who built a
large part of the present castle in the tenth century.</p>

<p>The view from the castle keep is described by
one who has written much of its legends and history:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>&ldquo;Northwards and southwards the broad Vale of
Berkeley, rich with verdure of pasture and woodland,
runs on into the far distance. To the east
and southeast are the Cotswolds, rising abruptly
here and there into bold, bare masses whose sides
are clothed with beech woods, and anon retiring
into lovely valleys which seem to invite the eye to
range their recesses. On the west flows the broad
estuary of the Severn, studded with many a white
sail; beyond it are the dark wooded hills of the
Forest of Dean, veiled by the smoke of its iron-works
and collieries. Under the walls of the castle,
on the north and west sides, the little town seems to
nestle, as though seeking shelter and protection from
the grim old fortress, which was probably its origin
and has been its stay and support through so many
generations.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">BERKELEY CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Berkeley has another claim to distinction aside
from its castle, for here is the cottage where lived
Jenner, whose discovery of vaccination placed under
control the scourge that devastated Europe until
quite recent times. The famous physician is buried
in the churchyard. The church is of imposing dimensions,
with stained glass better than the average
and elaborate tombs of the Lords of Berkeley
Castle. The bell tower is detached, standing some
distance from the main structure.</p>

<p>The highway from Bristol to Gloucester is one
of the finest in the Kingdom, and we soon resumed
our flight over it after the short detour to Berkeley.
At the Bell Hotel in Gloucester we found mild excitement
prevailing among the guests and servants,
some of the latter standing about in brilliant liveries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and powdered wigs. The manageress explained
that the high sheriff and county judge were about to
leave the hotel and that the gaudy attire we beheld
disguised only the porter and head waiter, who had
been fitted out in this manner to give due state to
the occasion. During the delay in the departure
of the distinguished guests we had the services of
one of the gorgeous gentlemen at our luncheon.
Finally the dignitaries descended the stair, the bedecked
servants bowed them solemnly into a carriage,
and the porter in all his glory rode away beside
the driver. I dwell on this incident, trifling in
itself, to illustrate the different status of such officials
in England as compared with our own country. In
America a dozen county judges and sheriffs might
be at a hotel in a city the size of Gloucester without
attracting much attention. In some respects the
English way is preferable, since it invests the representatives
of the law with a dignity quite lacking
in the States. And in this connection we might notice
that county judges in England receive salaries
from three to five times as great as are paid to corresponding
officials on our side, thus commanding a
high average of legal talent for the bench.</p>

<p>The half-dozen miles between Gloucester and
Tewkesbury are quickly done and we halt in front
of a wide green, studded with gigantic trees, amidst
which rises the huge bulk of a church almost as im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>posing
as the cathedral that has barely faded from
our view. But it lacks the gracefulness and perfect
proportion of the Gloucester church and perhaps its
most striking exterior feature is the arch over the
western windows, so high and majestic as to remind
one of Peterborough. The interior is mainly ponderous
Norman&mdash;rows of heavy pillars flanking the
long nave and supporting massive rounded arches.
The windows, however, are the lighter and more
graceful creations of the Decorated Period, though
the glass is mostly modern. Among the tombs is
that of Prince Edward, son of Henry VI., who
was cruelly slain in the battle of Tewkesbury, so
fatal to the Lancastrian cause. Here, too, lies the
&ldquo;false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,&rdquo; of Shakespeare;
and Somerset, executed by his captors after the battle.
The abbey was marked for destruction by Henry
VIII., who was deterred from his purpose by a
public subscription. Tewkesbury is rather decadent,
and has many houses in brick and timber as yet
quite unspoiled by modern improvement. It is
pleasantly situated on the banks of the classic Avon
near its junction with the Severn, and the many-arched
stone bridge over the former river is unusually
picturesque. Half a mile farther a second
bridge crosses the Severn, which lies in broad, still
reaches dotted with small craft of every description.</p>

<p>Over these bridges we hastened away toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Hereford, following a level though sinuous road.
The old-world quaintness of Ledbury attracted our
attention. Its rectangular timber market cross, supported
on a colonnade of wooden pillars, is unusual
indeed. And nowhere else did we find finer
specimens of Elizabethan half-timbered houses,
though some of them were rather tawdry in recent
applications of black and white paint. Such houses
have become quite the rage and some owners have
gone so far as to paint black stripes on common
brick to represent the timbers. However, no such
travesty as this is necessary in Ledbury&mdash;the town
is overflowing with the genuine article&mdash;genuine
though disfigured in some cases by the bad taste of
the man with the paint pot. Church Lane, leading
from the main street up a gentle slope to the church,
is bordered with splendid examples of Elizabethan
houses, quite unaltered since they left the builders&rsquo;
hands. At the end of the lane one sees a graceful
spire standing apart from the church, which is quite
unique in design. It has four sharply pitched roofs
running parallel, with odd little minarets between
them. The interior has the newness of recent restoration
and shows traces of different styles, from
Norman to Perpendicular. Ledbury has an institute
which commemorates its association with Elizabeth
Barrett Browning, who passed her girlhood
near the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>At Hereford we sought the cathedral, having
missed the interior during a former visit. A small,
bare-headed boy in a red sweater saw us pause before
the close and marked us as his legitimate prey.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you into the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace,&rdquo; he said
in such a matter-of-fact way that it disarmed our
suspicions and we followed the youngster meekly
enough, for with all our doing of cathedrals we had
caught only glimpses of bishops&rsquo; palaces, usually
embowered in gardens and apparently quite inaccessible.
We had no opportunity to question our
small guide as he rapidly led us through the palace
grounds, but when he unhesitatingly rang at the
door, we insisted on an explanation and learned that
the bishop and his family were in London. During
their absence the palace was thrown open to the
public and our small friend was doubtless improving
the opportunity to put cathedral visitors under obligations
to himself.</p>

<p>We were admitted and wandered about at
will. It is a rambling old house and indicates that
a bishop occupies about the same plane in his domestic
appointments as a prosperous member of the
nobility, among whom, in fact, he takes a high rank.
The house was sumptuously furnished and had several
great rooms with high decorated ceilings and
windows that looked out on the pleasant grounds,
bright with flowers and shrubbery. The study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
pleased us most, with its high bookshelves about the
walls and tall mullioned bow windows which open
almost directly on the Wye. It was easy to see why
the English bishops nearly all complain that their
salaries, though apparently large, are hardly adequate
to the state they are expected to maintain;
and why, as in the case of an American ambassador,
a private fortune is often necessary to enable the
recipient of such an honor to pay the legitimate expenses.
Our picture will show, perhaps better than
any description, the beauty of the river front of the
palace, with the fine trees and cathedral tower in
the background. We had only a moment to look
about the cathedral, since the closing hour was nearly
at hand. However, we missed little, for Hereford
Cathedral has few historic associations and recent
restoration gives it an almost new appearance.
It is built of red sandstone, which gives the interior
a rather warm tone, accentuated by highly-colored
modern windows.</p>

<p class="caption">BISHOP&rsquo;S PALACE, HEREFORD.</p>
</div>

<p>A pause for the night at Ludlow, where we
arrived after a run of an hour or two through the
rich pasture lands along the Welsh Border, gave
us an opportunity of renewing our pleasant associations
with that fine old town. But as we were to
visit Ludlow thrice before the close of our pilgrimage,
I shall leave our impressions and discoveries for
later consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>The road from Ludlow to Bridgnorth is&mdash;or
rather was&mdash;not a first-class one. Road conditions
in Britain change so rapidly since the advent of the
motor that one can scarcely speak of them in the
present tense. As we found it, poorly surfaced,
narrow and winding, it was not to be compared with
the highway along the border. Bridgnorth is an
ancient market town, famous for its cattle fair, which
has been held yearly since 1226. The service at
the Crown Inn, where we stopped for luncheon,
was excellent, and the moderate charge proved
Bridgnorth off the beaten tourist track, a special
rate not yet being established for the infrequent motorists.
It was market day and the town was
crowded with country people. The ample market
square was filled with booths, and goods of every
description were offered for sale. A socialist orator&mdash;a
common nuisance in England&mdash;was haranguing
the people, who crowded the streets so closely
that we could get through only with difficulty.
That motors are not so common in Bridgnorth was
apparent, and a crowd collected about the car in
the hotel stableyard. The general expression was
hostile, and many instances were related where &ldquo;one
of the things&rdquo; had worked disaster with skittish
horses.</p>

<p>We made our escape without entering into the
discussion and dropped down the almost precipi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>tous
hill to the Severn bridge. The road is a
charming one, with wooded hills rising sharply on
one hand and the broad Severn lying far beneath
on the other. At Shifnal a policeman, in response
to our inquiry, directed us to the byway leading to
the village of Tong, some three miles distant. Here,
according to one well qualified to judge, is the &ldquo;most
interesting example of early Perpendicular architecture
in Shropshire&mdash;a section famous for interesting
churches.&rdquo; But it is better known through its association
with Little Nell in &ldquo;Old Curiosity Shop,&rdquo;
and Dickens&rsquo; description shows that the appearance
of the church before its restoration was quite different
from today:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The church was old and grey, with ivy clinging
to the walls and round the porch. It was a
very quiet place, as such a place should be, save
for the cawing of the rooks, who had built their
nests among the branches of some tall trees. It was
a very aged, ghostly place. The church had been
built many hundreds of years ago and once had a
convent or monastery attached; for arches in ruins,
remains of oriel windows, and fragments of blackened
walls were yet standing.&rdquo; It is still old and
gray, but no longer ghostly and ruinous. It was
far from lonely, for a crowd of trippers was being
shown about by the caretaker when we arrived.</p>

<p>The tombs of Tong Church, with their effigies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and brasses, are remarkably perfect, and one of
them must be very ancient, for it bears the figure of
a crusader in chain mail. The images escaped destruction,
it is said, because of the friendship of
Cromwell for the Stanleys, who were adherents of
the Parliament. In the church are buried several
of the Vernons, whom the madcap Dorothy gave to
eternal fame, for they had little else to rescue them
from the oblivion that overwhelmed such a host of
unremembered squires and knights. Dorothy&rsquo;s sister,
Margaret, is buried with her husband, Sir Edward
Stanley, who came into possession of Tong
Castle through his wife. The church also has a
remarkable library of black-letter books, some of
them almost as old as the church itself, and a stupendous
bell, weighing two tons, hangs in its tower.</p>

<div class="center">
<a name="bw_12" id="bw_12"></a><img src="images/bw_12.jpg" width="600" height="421" alt="" />
<p class="caption">TONG VILLAGE, SHROPSHIRE.</p>
</div>

<p>The village well accords with the church&mdash;a
quiet place half hidden by trees and shrubbery,
while the ivy and blooming vines give a touch of
color to the gray walls. The tiny gardens are brilliant
with old-fashioned flowers and the air is laden
with their sweetness. Amidst such surroundings are
scattered the pleasant old timbered cottages, with
thatched roofs and diamond-paned lattice windows.
The original castle has disappeared and has been
replaced by a large Georgian house&mdash;a Moorish-looking
mansion with domed roofs and pinnacles,
yet rather picturesque, despite the fact that it out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>rages
good architectural taste. It is in ill accord
with the unspoiled little village; for altogether, Tong,
with its church and associations, is one of the most
delightful nooks and thoroughly typical of rural England
at its best.</p>

<p>There are other associations in the neighborhood
of Tong that may attract anyone especially interested
in curious bits of English history, for near
at hand is Boscobel House and its Royal Oak. In
my youthful days, I read in one of the old-fashioned
Sunday school books&mdash;many of which were then
imported from England and were written by orthodox
royalists&mdash;the story of the miraculous escape
of His Gracious Majesty Charles II. from the wicked
rebels who sought to lay violent hands on the
&ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Anointed.&rdquo; I looked on the honest
country people of Boscobel as direct instruments of
Providence in preserving the sacred life of the king,
and fairly held my breath with fear and excitement
when I read that the Puritan troopers rode beneath
the very tree in which the monarch was concealed.
Even when sadly disenchanted by the knowledge
that if ever rascal escaped his due it was when
Charles Stuart dodged his pursuers, the romance of
the old story lingered and I always had a desire
to see Boscobel House and the Royal Oak.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">BOSCOBEL HOUSE, SHROPSHIRE.</p>
</div>

<p>After leaving Tong we were only a few minutes
in the shady lanes until we drew up in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
of the ancient manor and found it a shrine for the
English tripper, though the name of no American
had been registered in its visitors&rsquo; book. The house
is quite unaltered and of itself would be worth a
visit as an unusually good specimen of early English
domestic architecture, for it dates from 1540. The
walls are stuccoed between heavy oaken posts at
the corners and beams at the line of the floors. The
huge chimney, mullioned windows and other touches
indicate that it was a gentleman&rsquo;s residence. Inside
there are several fine rooms, with much oak carving
and paneling, though in the dining-room, rather the
best of all, the oak has been painted. There are
a good many portraits and relics of the king, more
or less authentic, which are shown with a proper
degree of reverence. In the attic floor is the entrance
to a small secret chamber reputed as one of
the hiding-places of the king, though no doubt originally
planned for a &ldquo;priest hole,&rdquo; as the Puritans
called such places of concealment.</p>

<p>The farm-wife who cared for the house, and who
was glad to see visitors, had come to reverence the
king as the saint that the old chronicles picture
him and had a full stock of the traditions of the
place. She pointed out the identical tree which
sheltered his Sacred Majesty, though the prosaic
and unimpressionable Baedeker declares that it vanished
long ago&mdash;which we ventured to hint, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
to be met with proper scorn. To impress us with
the goodness and generosity of the king, she related
that the pension he settled on his preservers and their
heirs forever is still paid to the descendants of the
Penderels by an assessment on the parish&mdash;characteristic
indeed of Charles, who always rewarded services
if he could do so at the expense of some one
else. We purchased a quaint book at the house&mdash;a
facsimile reprint of an account of the events at Boscobel,
published after the Restoration and dedicated
to the king. As a curious example of the depraved
lickspittle attitude of his flatterers toward the person
of the monarch&mdash;a spirit not altogether extinct today,
for that matter&mdash;I give a few sentences from the
author&rsquo;s dedication:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I humbly beg your Majesties pardon, being
conscious to myself of my utter incapacity to express,
either your unparallel&rsquo;d valour in the day of
contending, or (which is a vertue far less usual for
Kings) your strong and even mind in the time of
your sufferings. From which sublime endowments
of Your Most Heroick Majesty I derive these
comforts to my self, That whoever undertakes to
reach at your perfections, must fall short as well as
I, though not so much. And now, on my bended
knees, let me joyfully congratulate his restored Majesty,
and humbly offer him this short and hearty
wish, O KING, LIVE FOR EVER.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidding Boscobel Manor farewell, we pause
for a hasty glance at the scant ruin of White Ladies,
an old-time nunnery standing quite apart in a field
near by; then we retrace our way to the main road
leading through Tong to Newmarket and Market
Drayton. The latter town should be of considerable
interest to an Englishman, since here was the
home of Robert Clive, who, according to a well-known
historian, &ldquo;will ever be remembered as the
man who laid deeply the foundations of our Indian
Empire and who at a time of national despondency
restored the tarnished honor of British arms.&rdquo; Aside
from this, there is little to interest the wayfarer save
several fine Elizabethan houses and a mighty church
that quite overshadows the town and country.</p>

<p>We are soon away for Shrewsbury, the ever
charming county town of Shropshire, fleeting over
as fine a road as ever tempted the winged wheels of
a motor car. It is nearly deserted, straight, broad
and level, and it is quite too late to fear the minions
of the law&mdash;but this is not a record of miles per
hour. Suffice it to say that very shortly we stop at
the sign of the Raven in Old Salop.</p>

<p>One could never grow weary of the old town,
and we saw another phase in its life and activity on
a Saturday evening. The whole population seemed
to have turned loose, and the brilliantly lighted main
street was quite metropolitan. The quaint old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
fronts had a rather odd and out-of-place look in the
glare of the electric light; the narrow, dimly lit side
streets were more in accord with the spirit of the
place. The shops were crowded and on the whole
seemed surprisingly up to date and well stocked
for a town of thirty thousand.</p>

<p>The Sunday following was as quiet as the evening
before had been animated, and was as perfect
as an English June day can be. In the afternoon
we were off for a run, with scarcely any definite
point in view, though a jaunt of an hour or
two brought us in front of Lichfield Cathedral just
as the afternoon service was beginning. We joined
the rather diminutive body of worshippers who occupied
but a small part of the great church. We
were perhaps quite as intent on the interior&mdash;a very
epic in warm red sandstone&mdash;as upon the dreary
chant of the litany. A thorough restoration has
been made recently and an air of newness prevails,
but no one interested in cathedral architecture will
miss Lichfield&mdash;in some respects the most harmonious
and best proportioned of them all. We have
seen the town before, but not the large square house
before which we pause, for a moment, and which
bears a bronze tablet to the memory of its one-time
occupant, Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles
Darwin.</p>

<p>Our route to Shrewsbury was over one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Roman Watling streets, straight as an arrow&rsquo;s flight
much of the way and often bordered by giant trees.
Never did the English countryside appear more
charming in all our wanderings through it. There
was a continual succession of green fields, vast parks,
clear streams and wooded hills, with an occasional
retired village&mdash;for on our return we avoided Wolverhampton
with its rough streets and trams&mdash;to lend
variety to the rural beauty through which we passed
until we again skirted the Severn and re-entered the
town.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a><br />
A WEEK IN SOUTH WALES</h2>

<p>We leave Shrewsbury by the Welsh bridge for
a week among the rugged hills and valleys of Southern
Wales, a country rich in relics of antiquity and
romantic associations. We sweep along the fine
highway to Welshpool and from thence, a little
farther, to Montgomery, a decayed, out-of-the-way
town in the hills. A fragment of its castle is perched
high on the precipitous hill commanding the town
and looking far over the vale of the serpentine Severn.
The Severn, like the Wye, is the most sinuous
of rivers, and there are few more inspiring prospects
than its long shining folds winding through the verdant
valley as seen from the castle walls. Montgomery,
quiet and unheroic as it is today, has a
stirring past. It took its name from Roger de Montgomerie,
&ldquo;Second in command in the army of his
kinsman, William of Normandy,&rdquo; though the grim,
almost inaccessible castle antedated his possession
of the town. Fierce indeed was the strife between
the Normans and the wild Welsh tribes, and the
fair vale of the Severn was the scene of many a
bloody conflict. The castle, though with varying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
owners and fortunes, continued a stronghold to the
day of its surrender to the soldiers of the Commonwealth;
after which nothing remained but blackened
walls&mdash;another added to the long list of feudal fortresses
&ldquo;destroyed by Cromwell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The road southward from Newtown leads
through as wild a tract of country as we saw in
Britain. Not the Scotch Highlands or the hills at
the headwaters of the Welsh Wye equal it in loneliness
and seeming remoteness. But it is more picturesque
than the localities just named, for the hills
are mostly wooded, and the shallow, sparkling river
which we followed&mdash;though usually far above it&mdash;runs
through a narrow valley diversified in spots with
trees and bits of meadow land. For eight miles out
of Newtown we encountered a continually rising
grade, which brought us to a narrow upland road
running along the hillsides, which drop in almost precipitous
slopes to the river far below. The road
twists along the edge of the hills, at times in almost
circular curves, and too close to the sharp declivity
at its side for one&rsquo;s ease of mind. At Llandrindod
Wells we had passed the wildest part of the road
and we noted with surprise the handsome houses
and palatial hotels of a town we had scarcely heard
of before, but which has recently become the queen
of Welsh inland resorts. The declining sun shot
his rays along the purple hilltops that encircle the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
place and the shadows were already long in the
pine-clad valleys. It was growing late, but after
a hurried consultation we decided against the pretentious
hotels of Llandrindod Wells.</p>

<p>We dashed across the arched stone bridge
over the Wye at Builth Wells and brought sharply
up in front of the Lion Hotel, which, standing
squarely across the way, seemed to bar farther progress,
and we had little choice but to stop for the
night. The Lion&rsquo;s accommodations are not elaborate
by any means, but it was quite too late to go
farther. Though Builth has mineral wells and a
&ldquo;pump house,&rdquo; a mile from the town, there is nothing
of the resort hotel about the Lion; on the contrary,
it is the plainest of old-country inns, apparently
a haven for fishermen rather than health seekers.
Its walls were covered with the antique hand-colored
prints so characteristic of English inns; its
mantels were loaded with queer pieces of bric-a-brac;
tallow candles lighted the bedrooms. The
electric push-button had not superseded the tasseled
rope by the bedside, with which one jangles
a bell hung on a coiled spring in the hallway. But
it is spacious and has an air of old-world comfort
about it&mdash;little modern except its motor garage.</p>

<p>After all, we were fortunate in our pause at
Builth, for we beheld the most glorious of sunsets
on the long reaches of the Wye as it enters the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
town from the west. The river dances down the
valley in a series of broad, shallow rapids, resting
itself here and there in a quiet lakelike pool. The
sunset hues were subdued rather than brilliant; pink
and salmon tints were reflected in the stream as we
stood on the bridge and looked up the quiet valley,
and these faded into hazy amethyst as the twilight
advanced. It was a scene of quiet, pastoral beauty
amidst surroundings that do not lack for legend and
antiquity, and altogether left a pleasing recollection
of an unattractive Welsh town which in itself
has little of the picturesque.</p>

<p>We were away early in the morning following
the Wye Valley road, with its vistas of hill and
river, as far as Llyswen, where we crossed the hills
to Brecon. Our stop here was short, as our route
was to bring us again to this interesting old town in
a few days. We did not often find a more delightful
road than that down the Usk Valley to Crickhowell,
Abergavenny and Caerleon. Its excellent
surface and long sweeping grades might be a temptation
to speed, but it is quite neutralized by the
constant beauty of the scenery and interest of the
country. On either hand are the low Welsh mountains,
wooded to the very crest, and at times far
below we caught the gleam of the river&mdash;though
so shrunken as to scarcely deserve the name&mdash;leaping
and flashing over its stone-strewn bed. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and there a quiet village nestled unobtrusively by
the roadside; at Crickhowell we found a larger but
somnolent town whose huge church is crowded with
memorials of the old Welsh warriors. Even larger
and more impressive is the great Priory Church
at Abergavenny, whose square battlemented tower
one might think had been built to withstand the
sieges of the devil, even as the Welsh castles were
made almost impregnable against the attack of man.
No quainter town did we pass than Usk; it must
have been much the same when the Conqueror sent
his legions to overawe the Welsh tribes, save that
its castle, then no doubt a lordly fortress, is now a
decayed ivy-mantled ruin. Its greater importance
in years gone by is attested by its mighty priory
church, ill in keeping with the hamlet that clusters
about it today. According to tradition, two kings
of England were born in Usk&mdash;Richard III. and
Edward IV.&mdash;and Roman remains indicate an important
station on the spot almost at the dawn of
the Christian Era.</p>

<p>But what shall one say of Caerleon, farther
down the valley, now practically a suburb of Newport,
where dim legends still linger to the effect
that it was once King Arthur&rsquo;s capital and that
here was the castle</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&ldquo;From whose high towers they say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men saw the goodly hills of Somerset,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And white sails flying o&rsquo;er a yellow sea.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A prosaic historian, however, declares that in
all likelihood the King Arthur legend sprang from
Roman ruins which some hundreds of years ago
existed in Caerleon in great magnificence. At any
rate, modern Caerleon has no trace of the regal
capital of the early king&mdash;a bald, unattractive town
close upon the Usk, now broadened into a considerable
stream, dull with the taint from the manufactories
on its banks.</p>

<p>At Newport we are entering a different order
of things, brought about by the great industrial development
in South Wales due to the coal and
iron mines and large shipping interests. In the last
century the population of the town has grown from
one to seventy thousand. The old order is indeed
dead here. There is no effort to attract the tourist,
and the castle, almost the sole relic of antiquity,
is crumbling into unhindered ruin as it sits far above
the drear expanse of mud left by the receding tide.
We hasten through the town&mdash;we may see a hundred
such at home&mdash;and seek from a friendly policeman
the road to Caerphilly, a village off in the
hills which we know has no new-world counterpart.</p>

<p>For ten miles from Newport we wend our way
over a dusty, ill-kept byroad with sharp turns and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
steep grades, and before we come to the village we
see from some distance the broken towers and battlements
of Caerphilly Castle. We pass through
the gateway in the straggling walls and the scene of
desolation and massive ruin that lies before us is
hardly paralleled in impressiveness among British
castles, unless it be by Corfe in Dorset. A great
round tower, perhaps fifty feet in diameter, with
walls ten feet thick, split as by a thunder stroke,
greets our eyes. Half of it is still standing, though
leaning many feet from the vertical, and the other
half lies in mighty fragments of masonry at its base.
There had been four such towers, but only one is
comparatively entire. The walls, though much
shattered in places, still serve to give an idea of
the vast extent of the ancient castle. The huge banqueting
hall has been roofed and recalls in a rather
pathetic way the rude magnificence of its feudal state.</p>

<p class="caption">CAERPHILLY CASTLE, SOUTH WALES.</p>
</div>

<p>But words quite fail to describe Caerphilly&mdash;such
a maze of grim walls and towers, such a network
of ruinous apartments, piled deep with debris,
overawe and confuse one. Only the antiquarian
may painfully decipher the plan of the castle and
in imagination reconstruct it as it was when it stood
a bulwark between warring nations. But to the ordinary
beholder it will remain a mystery set in the
midst of the barren hills, and he will hardly care to
resolve the impressive pile into its original parts. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
will seem an entity to him&mdash;it is hard to think it
otherwise than it appears today. Its romance is
deepened by the obscurity of its history&mdash;for the
story of Caerphilly has many blanks and breaks.
There is no record of when it was first begun and
there is doubt as to when it was finally destroyed.
Some say the ruin is the work of Cromwell, and
it surely seems worthy of that master of the art of
wrecking castles; others declare that it was abandoned
at the time of the Commonwealth, having
been destroyed by Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wild irregular
Glendower,&rdquo; in his endless conflicts with the English.</p>

<p>But after all, does it not savor even more of
romance that mystery enshrouds the past of the stupendous
structure whose scanty remnants encircle
us? Why call upon prosaic history to dispel the
charm that emanates from the gray ruin, half hidden
by its mantle of ivy and dashed here and there
with the purple valerian and yellow wall-flower?
Such would be folly indeed as we sit on the soft
green turf of the court and contemplate the fantastic
outlines in the glow of the sunset; when all is
silence save for the angry brawls of the rooks, which
have entered into full possession&mdash;reincarnations,
perhaps, of the erstwhile contentious owners.</p>

<p>But the spell of Caerphilly dissolves and a
different world surrounds us as we enter the broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
modern streets of Cardiff and pause before the
American-looking Park Hotel. Cardiff as a village
antedates the Conquest, but as a metropolis
of two hundred thousand, it is quite recent. One
hundred years ago it had a population of a thousand;
in 1837, of ten thousand; and it is easy
to see that the traces of antiquity in such a city must
be few. Its future was assured when the first Marquis
of Bute hazarded his entire fortune in the construction
of the extensive docks from which shipments
of coal and iron are now made. It was a
lucky throw of the die for the nobleman, for today
his grandson owns the greater part of Cardiff and
is one of the wealthiest men in the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Cardiff Castle&mdash;forever associated with the
dark fate of Prince Robert&mdash;has been replaced by
a Moorish palace&mdash;or rather, an incongruous mixture
in which the Moorish predominates. It is easy
to gain admittance to this imposing palace, where
art has been entirely unhampered by cost, and if
garishness and incongruity sometimes prevail, interest
is nevertheless continual. There is a fragment
of the keep of the old castle in the grounds
and Duke Robert&rsquo;s dungeon is incorporated into the
new structure&mdash;a dark, vaultlike cavity in the walls
where for thirty years the unfortunate prince, the
direct heir to the throne of the Conqueror, was
kept a close prisoner by his brother Henry. Legend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
has it that his eyes were put out because of an attempt
to escape and that he died in the dungeon at
the age of eighty years.</p>

<p class="caption">CARDIFF CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Cardiff&rsquo;s municipal buildings are a delight;
white stone palaces standing in ample grounds with
wide pleasant approaches&mdash;altogether models of
what civic structures ought to be. Immense and
busy as it is, there is little in Cardiff to detain one
on such a pilgrimage as ours, and we were away
before noon on the Swansea road.</p>

<p>Llandaff is but three miles from Cardiff, and
we reached it by a short detour. Its cathedral, recently
restored, is probably the most interesting of
Welsh churches excepting St. David&rsquo;s. The site
has been occupied by a church ever since the year
600, though the present structure dates from early
Norman times. It fell into complete ruin after the
time of the Commonwealth. One chronicler declares
that &ldquo;Cromwell&rsquo;s men turned the nave into an
ale house, penned calves in the choir and fed pigs at
the font,&rdquo; though they must have been rather unorthodox
Puritans to countenance the ale house. No
attempt was made to preserve the fine church from
decay until about two hundred years later, and so
deplorable was its condition that the task of restoration
seemed a well-nigh impossible one. Still, after
much difficulty, the work was happily carried out,
and the twin towers&mdash;one a slender spire and its com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>panion
square-topped with Gothic finials&mdash;present
a very unusual though not unpleasant effect. Inside
there is a mixture of Norman and early English
styles, and some beautiful Decorated work. There
are three paintings by Dante Gabriel Rossetti that
arrest attention at once&mdash;done in that artist&rsquo;s best
style long ere he was known to fame. The windows,
though modern, are of unusual excellence, having
been designed by Burne-Jones and other notable
artists. Near by are the ruins of the bishop&rsquo;s palace,
whose fortresslike walls tell of a time when the
churchman and the warrior went hand in hand. Its
destruction some six hundred years ago is attributed
to Owen Glendwr, whose record for castle-smashing
in Wales is second only to that of Cromwell.
The village of Llandaff is still rural and pretty; it is
quite clear of the skirts of Cardiff, being separated
from the city by the River Taff. The old stone
cross still stands in front of the palace and there is
now little to remind one of the big modern city near
at hand, which may one day absorb its ancient but
diminutive neighbor.</p>

<p>The Swansea road looks well enough on the
map, but our recollections of it are far from pleasing.
Dusty and rough, and crowded with traffic
and tram lines in many places, it wends through a
cheerless and often uninteresting country. It passes
frequent mining towns straggling along for con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>siderable
distances and there were many drunken
men reeling on the streets. It was market day at
Cowbridge and the village was filled with countrymen,
many of whom treated our right to the road
with supreme indifference. One fellow in a broad-brimmed
slouch hat that made him look like an
American cowboy, and who was carrying a black
bottle that might hold a gallon, saluted us with owl-like
gravity and brought the car to a sharp stop by
standing directly in our way.</p>

<p>While getting rid of our would-be acquaintance,
we cast about to find a place for luncheon and
soon lighted on the sign of the Bear, the sole inn,
according to Baedeker. It was some distance to
the next town and we decided to patronize the
Bear, though its outer appearance filled us with misgivings.
But if its outward aspect inspired doubt,
words fail in speaking of the inside. The handbook
of the Royal Automobile Club in setting
forth the delights of a tour in America pays its compliments
to our rural Bonifaces in this wise: &ldquo;The
hotel accommodation in country districts is often
very poor and dirty,&rdquo; all of which may be painfully
true. But in competition for distinction in these
particulars, the Bear would certainly not be distanced
by any American rival. Perhaps the confusion
and disarray was partly due to the market-day
rush, but the grime and dirt that prevailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
everywhere seemed as ancient as the ramshackle old
house itself. The dining-room was a large apartment
with many long tables of boards laid on
trestles&mdash;an arrangement, no doubt, to accommodate
the patronage of market day&mdash;and the remnants
of the dinner were still heaped upon them in
dire confusion. A glance at the meal placed before
us and at the dirty hands of the waiting-girl
was enough&mdash;we left the provender untouched and
summarily departed from the table. With difficulty
we got the attention of the barmaid, who also acted
as cashier, settled our score, and sallied forth dinnerless
upon the King&rsquo;s highway.</p>

<p>Threading our way carefully through the
streets of Neath, several miles farther on, with little
thought save to get away from the bad road and
unpleasant surroundings, we caught a glimpse,
down a side street, of an ivy-clad ruin of great extent.
We followed the rough rubbish-covered lane
that leads directly to the entrance gate of Neath
Abbey, as it proved to be. There was no caretaker
in charge, but two or three workmen were
engaged in cleaning away the debris, which was
several feet deep in many of the roofless apartments.
Everything indicated that once the abbey had
stood in the pleasantest of valleys on the bank of a
clear, placid little river; but the coaling industry,
which flings its pall over everything in Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Wales, had played sad havoc with the sylvan retreat
of the old Cistercian monks. Heaps of rubbish
dotted the uncared-for green about the place.
Coal trains rattled on the railroad near at hand.
The spot where the abbey now stands so forlornly
is the heart of the suburban slums of Neath, and so
isolated and forgotten is it that few pilgrims come
to view its melancholy beauty. For it is beautiful&mdash;does
not our picture tell the story?&mdash;the mouldering
walls hung with masses of ivy, the fine doorways,
the great groups of mullioned windows and the
high chimneys, green to the very tops, all combine
to charm the beholder despite the unlovely surroundings.
The workmen told us that the abbey
belonged to Lord Somebody&mdash;we have quite forgotten&mdash;and
that he was going to clean up the
premises and make necessary repairs. The craze
now so prevalent in Britain for preserving every
ancient ruin had extended even to Neath Abbey
and perchance its titled owner will beautify the
surroundings and the fine ruin may yet become a
shrine for pilgrims&mdash;that the motor-car will bring.</p>

<p class="caption">NEATH ABBEY, SOUTH WALES.</p>
</div>

<p>Swansea&mdash;Swansy, they call it&mdash;had always
brought to my mind, I hardly know why, the idea
of a seaside resort town; but never was preconceived
notion more erroneous. If there is a blacker,
uglier, more odoriferous town of the size in the
Kingdom, I do not recollect where it is. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
are the greatest copper smelting works in the world
and from these come the pungent, stifling odors
that so unpleasantly pervade the city. Here, too,
is the great steel plant of the Siemens Company
and many allied industries. And yet there was a
time when Swansea had at least the promise of a
resort town before it, when the poet Landor declared
that &ldquo;Italy has a fine climate but that of
Swansea is better; that it is the only spot in Britain
where one may have warmth without wet.&rdquo; Then
it had six hundred people, but now its population
exceeds one hundred thousand. We had no desire
to linger and rapidly climbed the long steep
hill that leads to the highland road to Carmarthen.
We soon left behind us the smoke and grime of the
collieries and smelting-works, and the road over
which we rapidly coursed took us through a rather
pretty rural section, though the hills are numerous
and steep.</p>

<p>It was late when we came into Carmarthen, a
bare, drab-colored town, but withal rather more
prosperous-looking than the average small town of
South Wales. The thirty-two miles to Haverfordwest
swept by too rapidly to permit us to see the
country other than as a fleeting panorama. Just as
the twilight faded into dark we came sharply into
Haverfordwest and with grave misgivings halted
at the Castle Hotel. Here we must stop, willy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
nilly, for there was nothing that promised better in
many miles. But to apply the cautious Yorkshireman&rsquo;s
expression to the Castle Hotel, &ldquo;It might be
worse,&rdquo; and we were willing to let the uncomfortable
feather-beds and the dingy candle-lit rooms
overlooking the stable yard, be atoned for by the
excellent dinner that our landlady prepared at so
late an hour.</p>

<p>We did not linger at Haverfordwest on the
following morning, though perhaps the castle and
the priory church might well have detained us. The
castle, which crowns the terribly steep hill to which
the town seems to cling somewhat precariously, has
been reduced to a county jail&mdash;or gaol, as the English
have it&mdash;and thus robbed of much of its
romance. Still, it is an impressive old fortress, dominating
the town with its huge bulk, and it has figured
much in the annals of Pembrokeshire.</p>

<p>Haverfordwest has a history antedating the
Conquest. It was undoubtedly a stopping-place for
the troops of pilgrims who in early days journeyed
to the sacred shrine of St. David&rsquo;s, the Ultima
Thule of Southern Wales, sixteen miles to the west,
following a tortuous road over many steep and
barren hills. The railroad ends at Haverfordwest
and no doubt the facilities for reaching St. David&rsquo;s
a thousand years ago were quite as good as today,
the daily mail cart and coach twice a week in season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
being the only regular means of transportation. No
wonder in days when strenuous journeys to distant
shrines were believed to be especially meritorious,
two trips to St. David&rsquo;s were allowed to confer the
spiritual benefit of a single pilgrimage to Rome itself.</p>

<p>And we ourselves are pilgrims to St. David&rsquo;s
shrine&mdash;not by the slow horseback cavalcade of
old days, or the more modern coach, but by motor
car. Our forty-horse engine makes quick work of
the precipitous hill out of Haverfordwest and carries
us without lagging over the dozen long steep hills
on the road to the ancient town. Shortly before
reaching St. David&rsquo;s the road drops down to the
ocean side, but the sea is hidden by a long ridge
of stones and pebbles piled high by the inrushing
waters. The tide was far out and we saw no finer
beach on the Welsh coast than the one that lay
before us as we stood on the stony drift. A great
expanse of yellow&mdash;almost literally golden&mdash;sand
ran down to a pale green sea, which lapped it in
silvery sunlit ripples, so quiet and peaceful was the
day. But one could not but think of the scope afforded
for the wild play of the ocean on stormy
days&mdash;how the scene must be beyond all description</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;When the great winds shoreward blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the salt tides seaward flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the wild white horses play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Champ and chafe and toss in the spray.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>We left the car near the ancient stone cross
in the deserted market place of St. David&rsquo;s and
sought the cathedral, which is strangely situated in
a deep dell, the top of the Norman tower being
only a little above the level of the market place.
The cathedral has been recently restored, more perhaps
on account of its historic past than any present
need for it, but the bishop&rsquo;s palace, once one of
the most elaborate and extensive in the Kingdom,
stands in picturesque decay, beyond any hope of
rehabilitation. As to the old-time importance of
St. David&rsquo;s as contrasted with its present isolation,
the words of an enthusiastic English writer may
perhaps serve better than my own:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Centuries ago St. David&rsquo;s bishop had seven
palaces for his pleasure; now he does not dwell in
his own city. Of old the offerings at St. David&rsquo;s
shrine were divided every Saturday among the
priests by the dishful, to save time in counting the
coins; now a few pounds weekly is accounted a
good collection total. Ancient kings came hither in
state to confess their sins; in this travelling age only
the enterprising tourist comes to the city at all.
Eight or nine roads converged upon the little place
on its headland of about three miles square, but
the majority are now no better than humble weather-worn
lanes. The Atlantic winds sweep across the
depression by the Alan brook in which St. David&rsquo;s
Cathedral, the extensive ruins of the bishop&rsquo;s palace,
and the many other fragments of St. David&rsquo;s
glorious prime nestle among trees, with the humble
cottages of the city itself surrounding them as if
they loved them. Even the dilapidation here is so
graceful that one would hardly wish it altered into
the trim and rather smug completeness of many an
English cathedral with its close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cathedral is extremely interesting and made
doubly so by an intelligent verger whom we located
with considerable difficulty. Pilgrims to St. David&rsquo;s
were apparently too infrequent to justify the good
man&rsquo;s remaining constantly on duty as in larger
places, and a placard forbidding fees, may have
dampened his zeal in looking for visitors. But we
found him at last in his garden, and he did his part
well; nothing curious or important in the history
of the cathedral was forgotten by him. The leaning
Norman pillars, the open roof of Irish oak, the
gorgeous ceiling with its blood-red and gold decorations,
and many relics discovered during the restoration,
were pointed out and properly descanted upon.
But one might write volumes of a shrine which
kings once underwent many hardships to visit,
among them Harold the Saxon and his conqueror,
William of Normandy. Nothing but a visit can do
it justice, and with the advent of the motor car, old
St. David&rsquo;s will again be the shrine of an increas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>ing
number of pilgrims, though their mission and
personel be widely different from the wayfarers of
early days.</p>

<p class="caption">ST. DAVID&rsquo;S CATHEDRAL.</p>
</div>

<p>There is only one road out of the lonely little
town besides that which brought us thither and we
were soon upon the stony and uncomfortable highway
to Cardigan. Here we found roadmaking
in primitive stages; the broken stone had been
loosely scattered along the way waiting for the
heavy-wheeled carts of the farmers to serve the purpose
of the steam roller. The country is pitifully
barren and the little hovels&mdash;always gleaming with
whitewash&mdash;were later called to mind by those in
Ireland. There are no great parks with fine mansions
to relieve the monotony of the scene. Only
fugitive glimpses of the ocean from the upland road
occasionally lend a touch of variety. At Fishguard,
a mean little town with a future before it&mdash;for it is
now the Welsh terminus of the Great Western
Railway&rsquo;s route to Ireland&mdash;we paused in the
crowded market square and a courteous policeman
approached us, divining that we needed directions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The road to Cardigan? Straight ahead down
the hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks pretty steep,&rdquo; we suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but nothing to the one you must go up
out of the town. Just like the roofs of those houses
there, and the road rough and crooked. Yes, this
is all there is of Fishguard; pretty quiet place except
on market days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We thanked the officer and cautiously descended
the hill before us. We then climbed much
the steepest and most dangerous hill we found in all
the twelve thousand or more miles covered by our
wanderings. To our dismay, a grocer&rsquo;s cart across
the narrow road compelled us to stop midway on
the precipitous ascent, but the motor proved equal
to the task and we soon looked back down the frightful
declivity with a sigh of relief. We were told
later of a traveling showman who had been over all
the main roads of the Island with a traction engine
and who declared this the worst hill he knew of.</p>

<p>Newport&mdash;quite different from the Eastern
Welsh Newport&mdash;and Cardigan are quaint, old-world
villages, though now decayed and shrunken.
I will not write of them, though the history of each
is lost in the mists of antiquity and the former possesses
an imposing though ruinous castle. The
road between them is hilly, but the hills are well
wooded and the prospects often magnificent and
far-reaching. We found it much the same after
leaving Cardigan, though the country is distinctly
better and more pleasing than the extreme south.
The farm houses appear more prosperous, and well-cared-for
gardens surround them. Nowhere did we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
find the people kinder or more courteous. An instance
occurred at Carmarthen, where we stopped
to consult our maps. The owner of a near-by
jewelry shop came out and accosted us. Did we
want information about the roads? He had lived
in Carmarthen many years and was familiar with
all the roads about the town. To Llandovery?
We had come too far; the road north of the river
is the best and one of the prettiest in Wales. It
would be worth our while to go back a mile and take
this road.</p>

<p>Thanking him, we retraced our way through
the long main street of the town and were soon
away over one of the most perfect and beautiful of
Welsh highways. It runs in straight broad
stretches between rows of fine trees, past comfortable-looking
farm houses, and through cozy little
hamlets nestling amid trees and shrubbery, and
seems constantly to increase in charm until it takes
one into Llandovery, twenty-five miles from Carmarthen
and the center of one of the most picturesque
sections of Wales.</p>

<p>Lying among wooded hills in a valley where
two clear little rivers join their waters, Llandovery&mdash;the
church among the waters&mdash;is a village of surpassing
loveliness. The touch of antiquity so
necessary to complete the charm is in the merest
fragment of its castle, a mouldering bit of wall on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
a mound overlooking the rivers&mdash;dismantled &ldquo;by
Cromwell&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo; Delightful as the town is, its
surroundings are even more romantic. The highest
peaks of South Wales, the Beacon and the Black
Mountains, overlook it and in the recesses of these
rugged hills are many resorts for the fisherman and
summer excursionist. From the summits are vast
panoramas of wooded hills and verdant valleys.
The view is so far-reaching that on a clear day one
may see the ocean to the south; or, far distant in
the opposite direction, the snow-crowned mountains
of Northern Wales.</p>

<p>The road from Llandovery to Brecon is as
fine as that to Carmarthen, though it is more sinuous
and hilly. But it is perfectly surfaced and climbs
the hills in such long sweeping curves and easy
uniform grades that the steepest scarcely checks the
flight of our car as it hastens at a thirty-five mile
gait to Brecon. It is growing late&mdash;we might well
wish for more time to admire the views from the
hillside road. The valleys are shrouded in the
purple haze of twilight and the sky is rich with sunset
coloring. It has been a strenuous day for us&mdash;one
of our longest runs over much bad road. We
note with satisfaction the promise of a first-class
hotel at Brecon, though we find it crowded almost
to our exclusion. But we are so weary that we
vigorously protest and a little shifting&mdash;with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
complaint from the shifted parties&mdash;makes room for
us. We are told in awe-stricken whispers that the
congestion is partly due to the fact that Her Grace
the Duchess of B&mdash;&mdash; (wife of one of the richest peers
in England) has arrived at the hotel with her
retinue, traveling in two motor cars. She was
pointed out to us in the morning as she walked
along the promenade in very short skirts, accompanied
by her poodle. We heard of this duke often
in our journeyings, one old caretaker in a place
owned by the nobleman assuring us that his income
was no less than a guinea a minute! The duke
owns many blocks of buildings in some of the busiest
sections of London. The land occupied by them
came into possession of the family through the
marriage of the great-grandfather of the present
holder of the title with the daughter of a dairy
farmer who owned much of the quarter where
London real estate is now of fabulous value&mdash;thus
showing that some of the English aristocracy rose
to wealth by means quite as plebeian as some of
those across the water. Nowadays the penniless
duke would have crossed the Atlantic to recoup his
fortune, instead of turning to a rich dairyman&rsquo;s
daughter in his own country.</p>

<p>But in indulging in this more or less interesting
gossip, I am forgetting Brecon and the Castle Hotel,
rightly named in this instance, for the hotel owns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the old castle; it stands in the private grounds
which lie between the hotel and the river and are
beautified with flowers and shrubbery. Brecon
boasts of great antiquity and it was here that Sir
John Price made overtures to Henry VIII. which
resulted in the union of England and Wales. The
priory church is one of the largest and most important
in Wales and is interesting in architecture as well
as historical association. We saw the plain old house
where the ever-charming Mrs. Siddons was born&mdash;a
distinction of which Brecon is justly proud. And
Brecon is not without its legend of Charles the
Wanderer, who passed a day or two at the priory
during one of his hurried marches in Wales, and
the letter he wrote here is the first record we have
of his despair of the success of the royal cause.</p>

<p>My chapter is already too long&mdash;but what else
might be expected of an effort to crowd into a few
pages the record of sights and impressions that
might well fill a volume?</p>

SOME NOOKS AND CORNERS</h2>

<p>Early next day we were in Hereford, for it is
but forty miles from Brecon by the Wye Valley
road. It had been just one week since we had
passed through the town preparatory to our tour
of South Wales&mdash;a rather wearisome journey of
well upon a thousand miles over some of the worst
of Welsh roads. It was not strange, then, that we
gladly seized the opportunity for a short rest in Hereford.
There is something fascinating about the fine
old cathedral town. It appeals to one as a place
of repose and quiet, though this may be apparent
rather than real, for we found the Green Dragon
filled to the point of turning away would-be guests.
The town stands sedately in the midst of the broad,
level meadows which surround it on every side, and
through its very center meanders the Wye, the
queenliest of British rivers, as though loath to leave
the confines of such a pleasant place. It is a modern
city, despite its ancient history, for its old-time landmarks
have largely disappeared and its crowded
lanes have been superseded by broad streets. Even
the cathedral has a distressingly new appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
due to the recent restoration, and a public park
occupies the site of the vanished castle. But for
all that, one likes Hereford. Its newness is not the
cheap veneer so frequently evident in the resort
towns; it is solid and genuine throughout and there
are enough antique corners to redeem it from monotony.
To sum up our impressions, Hereford is a
place one would gladly visit again&mdash;and again.</p>

<p>Jotted down on our map adjacent to the
Tewkesbury road were blue crosses, indicating
several seldom-visited nooks and corners we had
learned of in our reading and which we determined
to explore. No recollection of our wanderings
comes back to us rosier with romance or more
freighted with the spirit of rural England than that
of our meanderings through the leafy byways of
Worcestershire in search of Birtsmorton, Ripple,
Stanton and Strensham. One will look long at the
map before he finds them and a deal of inquiry was
necessary before we reached Birtsmorton and its
strange moated manor, Moreton Court. No better
idea could be given of the somnolence and utter
retirement of the little hamlet than the words of a
local writer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Birtsmorton is remarkable for the almost total
absence of the usual signs of trade and industry;
even agriculture is prosecuted within such limits as
consist with leaving an ample portion of its surface
in the good feudal condition of extended sheep
walks and open downs. Such Birtsmorton has ever
been, such it still is&mdash;but, thanks to projected railroads,
such we trust it will not always be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The projected railroad has not yet arrived and
the lover of quietude and of the truly rural will hope
that it will still be long delayed. No quainter old
place did we find in our long quest for the quaint
than Moreton Court. Fancy a huge, rambling
house, a mixture of brick and half-timber, with a
great gateway over which the ancient port-cullis still
shows its teeth, surrounded closely on all sides by
the waters of a very broad moat and connected with
the outer world by a drawbridge. Once inside the
court, for you gain admission easily, you pause to
look at the strange assortment of gables, huge
chimneys and mullioned windows, all indicative of
ancient state. Not less interesting is the interior;
one finds a staircase of solid black oak with a queer,
twisted newelpost, dark corridors leading to massive
oaken doors, chambers with ceilings intersected by
heavy beams, and a state apartment of surpassing
beauty. This is a spacious room, paneled to the
ceiling with finely wrought dark oak, its mullioned
oriel windows overhanging the moat, which on this
side widens to a lake. A marvelous chimney-piece
with the arms of the ancient owners attracts atten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>tion
and the scutcheons of a dozen forgotten noblemen
are ranged as a frieze around the walls.</p>

<p>We will not seek to learn the history of the old
house, but some of its legends have a strange fascination.
It is surely appropriate that Moreton Court
should have its ghost&mdash;the &ldquo;lily maid&rdquo; who on
winter nights kneels over the grave of her murdered
lover in the adjoining churchyard. Her stern father
had driven her from his home because of her constancy
to her yeoman lover, whom he caused to be
hung on the false charge of stealing a cow. The
next morning the cruel sire found his daughter dead
at his door, covered with the winter snow. But
there is another grim old legend far better authenticated,
which had its origin in a sad incident occurring
at Moreton Court two or three centuries ago,
and a sermon is still annually preached in the church
against dueling. A pair of lovers were plighting their
troth in the manor gardens when an unsuccessful
rival of the happy youth chanced upon them and
a quarrel ensued which led to a duel fatal to both
of the combatants. The heart-broken maiden
ended her days in sorrow at Moreton Court and
left by will a fund to provide for this annual sermon.
Another weird story they tell of the great
Wolsey, in his youth chaplain to the lords of Moreton
Court. A recalcitrant priest from Little Malvern
Priory was condemned to crawl on all fours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
from his cell to the summit of Ragged-Stone Hill
and in his rage cursed all upon whom the shadow
of the hill should afterwards fall. Wolsey was one
day reading in the manor grounds when to his
horror he found that the fatal shadow of the hill-crest
enveloped him.</p>

<p>But today, for all its history and legend, Moreton
Court has degenerated into an ill-kept tenement
farmhouse and the banquet hall with its richly
moulded plaster roof is used as a storehouse for
cheese. The stagnant waters of the moat and the
uncleanly dairy yard directly in front of the house
accord ill with its old-time state and with our modern
notions of sanitation. The church near at hand is
older and quite as unique as the manor; little restoration
has interfered with its antique charm. Its
bench ends still show the Tudor Rose and are undoubtedly
those originally placed in the church. A
&ldquo;sanctuary ring&rdquo; in the door and an odd circular
alms-chest are very unusual and the altar tombs and
screens are worthy of notice. In the church are
buried the ancient lords of Moreton Court, who
sleep their long sleep while church and manor degenerate
into plebeian hands and gradually fall into
ruin.</p>

<p>We found it practically impossible at the close
of the day to trace on the map the maze of byways
we threaded before reaching Worcester, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
our wanderings come back only as a general impression.
We crossed the Severn at Tewkesbury but
did not enter the town. A departure from the
Worcester road into a narrow lane led us in a mile or
two into Ripple, one of the quaintest and coziest of
hamlets. Only a few thatched cottages clustered
about the stone market cross of immemorial days&mdash;cottages
overshadowed by no less immemorial elms,
mantled with ivy and dashed with the color of rose
vines. Near the cross, relics of days when there
were rogues in Ripple&mdash;surely there are none now&mdash;are
the oaken stocks and weather-beaten whipping-post.
What a quiet, dreamy, secluded place it
seems. It is hard indeed to imagine that within a
circle of fifty miles is a country teeming with cities.
If the village has any history we did not learn it&mdash;no
great man is connected with Ripple as Tennyson
with Somersby, though Ripple is not unlike Somersby.
Ripple is worth a day&rsquo;s journey just for itself.
Only one lane leads to the village, but we left it
over a wide common, passing many gates to regain
the main road.</p>

<div class="center">
<a name="bw_18" id="bw_18"></a><img src="images/bw_18.jpg" width="421" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">TOWN CROSS, STOCKS AND WHIPPING POST, RIPPLE.</p>
</div>

<p>We left this again in a few miles for Strensham,
a village not unlike Ripple, though larger. Its
church, our &ldquo;object of interest,&rdquo; is situated in the
fields a mile from the town. No open road leads
to it, only a rough stone-strewn path through the
fields. They told us, though, that we might take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the car to the church, and we passed through several
gates before we paused in the green meadow
in front of the old structure. There was no one in
charge; the doors were locked and it looked as if
our pains in coming were all for nothing. A man
who was trimming the hedge pointed out the rectory
and a little effort brought forth the rector himself,
who seemed much pleased that pilgrims should
be interested enough to come to his church.</p>

<p>Surely Strensham Church is one of the quaintest
of the smaller English churches. The restorer&rsquo;s
hand has not as yet marred its oddity&mdash;though
sorely needed, the rector said, to arrest too evident
decay. The floor is of uneven flagstones, interspersed
here and there with remnants of the original
tiling. The high-backed oaken pews have been
in place for centuries, but, alas, have been covered
by a coat of yellow &ldquo;grained&rdquo; paint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a man come from London to give me
the cost of removing the paint,&rdquo; said the rector,
&ldquo;but he said it would be sixty pounds&mdash;quite out
of the question when money is so much needed to
prevent actual decay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rood loft, bearing a dozen painted panels
of saints&mdash;as old, perhaps, as the church, yet with
colors rich and strong, is very remarkable. Each
face has a characteristic expression, in most cases
rather quaintly distorted, and each saint has some dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>tinguishing
mark, as St. Anthony with his pig. There
are several unusually fine brasses, but the best of these
had been torn from its original grave before the altar
a hundred years ago by an ambitious squire who
desired to occupy this place of honor himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But like the man in the scriptures who sought
the head of the table only to be humiliated, the
usurper is likely to be removed,&rdquo; said the rector,
&ldquo;and the fourteenth century brass replaced over the
grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little church seems lonely and poverty-stricken,
but the rectory near at hand is a large, comfortable
house surrounded by well-kept gardens.
Strensham village has a decided advantage over its
lowly neighbor, Ripple, for it is known to fame as
the birthplace of Samuel Butler, the author of
&ldquo;Hudibras.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A charming road leads through Upton-on-Severn
to Malvern Wells and Great Malvern, but
we had no leisure to contemplate its beauties; a car
was bent on passing us&mdash;to which we were much
averse, for the road was very dusty. We had only
a glimpse of the Malverns, with their endless array
of hotels, lodging-houses and other resort-town characteristics.
The two towns are practically continuous
and lie beneath the Malvern Hills, whose slopes,
diversified with stone-walled fields, groves and farm
villages, stretch away to the blue haze that nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
always envelops the summits. Yet Malvern is not
without a touch of antiquity&mdash;no doubt the Romans
had a station here and the splendid priory church
rivals some of the cathedrals in size and dignity.
Only scanty ruins remain of the domestic portions
of the abbey, which, with the great beautifully
carved Gothic gateway, constitute all that is left
of the old order besides the church. A delightful
feature of the towns is the Common&mdash;when we saw
it, fine stretches of greensward with many noble
trees. The Common was at one time a royal domain,
and Charles I. in his stresses for money undertook
to sell the land to raise funds, but such
rioting ensued in Malvern that a compromise was
effected by surrendering two-thirds of the Chase,
as the Common was then called, to the people.
Though the forests have been greatly thinned by
the ax, there still remains enough of sylvan beauty
to give to Malvern Common an indescribable
charm, and so intersected is it with sinuous roads
that it was with difficulty we started aright for
Worcester.</p>

<p>On our way to the cathedral city we passed the
battlefield where the momentous encounter took
place between the forces of Cromwell and the Royalists
under Prince Charles&mdash;or, as his followers
claimed, King Charles II. through his Scotch coronation&mdash;which
resulted in such disaster to the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
arms. Cromwell called it his &ldquo;crowning mercy,&rdquo;
and indeed it ended all organized efforts against
the Commonwealth while the Protector lived.
Charles fled to Boscobel, as already related, and
after many adventures reached France to remain
until peacefully recalled after Oliver&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>Worcester is one of the fine old towns that
tempt one to linger, no matter how often he may
come. Modern improvements have swept away
many of the relics of extreme antiquity; yet the
Romans were certainly here, and before them the
early Britons had a fortified town on the site. The
streets are now lined with attractive shops and here
is extensive manufacturing&mdash;few indeed are the
wayfarers who escape paying tribute to &ldquo;Royal
Worcester&rdquo; before they leave. Not a little of the
charm of the town is due to the Severn, lying broad,
bright and still in its very heart. We pause for
tea&mdash;again the mild dissipation of the Englishman
attracts us&mdash;at the Star Hotel, and as we depart
from the city look lingeringly at the majestic yet
graceful outlines of the cathedral towers against the
evening sky.</p>

</div>

<p>Coventry is but forty miles away. The King&rsquo;s
Head comes to our minds, though ever so faintly,
as something like home, and we may reach it by
the grace of the long twilight. And what a flight
it is&mdash;through the most delightful section of rural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
England, tinged with the golden glows and purple
shades of a perfect summer evening. We sweep
over the broad road to Droitwich, and as soon as
we can solve the mystery of its tortuous streets, we
enter the excellent though rather narrow and winding
highway that leads through Alcester to Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Stratford.</p>

<p>It had evidently been a gala day in the old
town, for the streets were thronged with people,
mostly from the surrounding country, though no
doubt there was a goodly number of our fellow-countrymen
in the crowd, since it was now the height
of the Stratford season. Under the circumstances,
the &ldquo;eight-mile&rdquo; limit notice posted on the roads entering
the town was quite superfluous; we could
scarcely have violated it&mdash;so it seemed, at least&mdash;had
it been only a mile an hour. Once away on
the surpassing road to Coventry, the fifteen miles
occupied scarce half an hour, despite the checks at
Warwick and Kenilworth. Coventry was thronged
with the happy &ldquo;Week-End&rdquo; holiday crowd,
through which we slowly made our way to the
King&rsquo;s Head, where we were now well known and
received as warm a welcome as one may find at an
inn.</p>

<p>Sunday, by odds the best day for getting about
London or the larger cities, is not so satisfactory for
touring in the rural sections. The roads are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
thronged with pedestrians, including many women
and children. Not a few of the women pushed perambulators
and often showed a strange perversity
in crossing to the farther side of the road in front
of the car. Besides, a number of the places one
may desire to visit are closed on Sundays, though
the tendency is constantly towards more liberality
in this particular. Yet there was nothing agreeable
in lounging about a hotel, and Sunday&mdash;afternoons,
at least&mdash;usually found us on the road. It was
very quiet in Nuneaton, the rather ugly town which
George Eliot made famous as &ldquo;Milby.&rdquo; The farmhouse
where the authoress was born and the old
manor, her home for many years, were not accessible.
The throngs of Sunday wayfarers made progress
slow, but we reached Tamworth for late luncheon
at the excellent Castle Hotel and learned that
the castle&mdash;the tower of Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo; would
be open during the afternoon.</p>

<p>Tamworth Castle is now the property of the
town corporation and the grounds have been converted
into a public park, which, judging from the
crowds that filled it on the fine afternoon, must be
well appreciated. The castle is situated on a high,
apparently artificial mound. It has been put in tolerable
repair and is used as a museum. So well
preserved is it that one may gain a good idea of the
domestic life of a feudal nobleman of the fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
century&mdash;a life comfortless and rude, judged by our
present standards. There is much paneling and
elaborate wood-carving on the walls and mantels of
many of the rooms, and one may be quite lost in
the devious passageways that lead to odd nooks
and quaint, irregular apartments. The view from
the keep tower, with its massive over-hanging battlements,
was indeed a lovely one. The day was
perfectly clear, permitting a far-reaching outlook
over the valley of the Tame, a fertile country of
meadow lands and yellowing harvest fields, while
westward in the distance the spires of Lichfield
pierced the silvery sky.</p>

<p>There is, perchance, something a little incongruous
in a restored and well-cared-for old-time castle
such as Tamworth. It can never appeal to the
imagination as does the shattered, neglected ruin
crumbling away beneath its mantle of ivy and flaunting
its banners of purple and yellow wall-flowers.
But after all, the Tamworth idea is the right one
and insures the preservation of many historic buildings
which otherwise might gradually fall into complete
decay. And yet one almost shudders to think
of Ludlow or Raglan under such conditions.</p>

<p>We hastened over the broad road to Lichfield,
and passing through its irregular streets, with which
we are now fairly familiar, followed the river to
Colwich, where we paused to admire the splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Decorated church which overshadows the quiet
village. But few prettier and more truly rural byroads
did we find anywhere than the one running
northward from Colwich to Uttoxeter. On either
side were flower-spangled hedge-rows, or in places
long ranks of over-arching trees. Though the road
was excellent, the trim neatness so characteristic of
England was quite wanting. The tangle of wild
flowers, vines and shrubbery was faintly suggestive
of country roadsides in some of our Western states.</p>

<p>Midway we came into full view of a lonely
ruined castle standing on the crest of a gently
rising hill, and surrounded by a lawnlike meadow
running down to the road. The ragged towers and
crumbling walls stood gray and forbidding against
a background of giant trees, and these were sharply
outlined against the bluest of English skies.
We learn later that it is Chartley Castle, which
stands in a tract of ancient forest and heath land,
upon which roams a herd of wild white cattle similar
to those of Chillingham. Over Chartley broods the
somber memory of its one-time owner, the Earl of
Ferrars, who in a fit of anger murdered a steward
and was hanged two centuries ago for the crime at
Tyburn. It was his whim to be dressed in his wedding
garments and hanged with a silken cord. He
was stoic to the last and would say no more than
he expressed in the misanthropic lines:</p>

<span class="i0">Yet stand prepared the vast abyss to try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And undismayed expect eternity.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A grim old tale that fits well with the lonely fortress,
standing in unguarded ruin in the mysterious
forest about it.</p>

</div>

<p>But the day was waning and we hastened on
to Uttoxeter, a town to which Nathaniel Hawthorne
made a pilgrimage nearly half a century ago,
attracted by the fact that it is the birthplace of Dr.
Samuel Johnson. He regretted that there was no
memorial of the great author in his native town, but
this has since been supplied. An ugly fountain has
been erected on the traditional spot where Johnson
did penance, as he described in a letter to Miss
Seward on his return from Uttoxeter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty years ago, madam, on the day, I committed
a breach of filial piety which has ever since
lain heavy on my mind, and has not till this day been
expiated. My father ... had long been in the
habit of attending Uttoxeter market and opening a
stall of his books during that day. Confined to his
bed by indisposition, he requested me, this time
fifty years, to visit the market in his place. But,
madam, my pride prevented me from doing my duty
and I gave my father a refusal. To do away the
sin of disobedience, this day I went in a post-chaise
to Uttoxeter, and going into the market at the time
of high business, uncovered my head and stood with
it bare an hour before the stall which my father
formerly used, exposed to the sneers of the standers-by
and the inclemency of the weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The open road to Derby is broad, straight,
smooth and level&mdash;what a combination of excellences
for the motorist!&mdash;and the car skims joyously
along. There are many fine estates on either hand
with wide forest-dotted parks and imposing gateways.
Derby is a large, rather unattractive town
and we do not care to linger. Mansfield appeals
more strongly to us, for Mansfield is the center of
the Byron country. The road is not a pleasing one,
passing through towns crowded with workingmen&rsquo;s
cottages and climbing steep, stony hills. At dusk
we come into Mansfield and find it a larger town
than we had fancied&mdash;a rather modern city built
around an ancient center, in the very heart of which
stands the old many-gabled Swan Inn.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX</a><br />
THE BYRON COUNTRY</h2>

<p>The exterior of the Swan Inn, its weather-beaten
gables crowded between rather shabby-looking
buildings on either side, is not wholly prepossessing.
We hesitate to enter the courtyard, though
it is quite late, until a policeman assures us there
is nothing better in the town&mdash;or in the country
about, for that matter. Had we needed further
assurance, we might have glanced at our trusty
Baedeker to find the Swan honored with special
mention as &ldquo;an excellent, long-established house
with winding oak stairs three hundred years old.&rdquo;
Once inside our misgivings vanish instantly amidst
the air of cleanliness, solid comfort and pleasant antiquity
that prevails. We have a large room, almost
oppressive in its wealth of mahogany, and,
dimly lighted by candles in ancient candlesticks, it
seems pervaded with an air of ghostly mystery.
There are tall-posted, canopied beds of marvelous
state, mysterious oaken chests heavily carved, antique
chairs, quaint old settees, and many curious
things wrought in brass and copper.</p>

<p>Altogether, few other of the country inns had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
quite the charm of the Swan, and very agreeable
did we find the ladies who managed it. We told
them of our previous futile attempts to see Newstead
Abbey and they were certain that the coveted
privilege would be secured for us on the following
day&mdash;it had never been refused to guests of the
Swan at the request of the manageress. She would
write at once and would doubtless have an answer
in the morning. It need hardly be said that we were
glad to stay another day at the Swan and in the
meanwhile visit some of the curious and delightful
spots in which Derbyshire abounds. No section of
England is more famed than the &ldquo;Peak District,&rdquo;
with Haddon Hall, Chatsworth, Bakewell Church,
Buxton and Dovedale; and though almost unknown
to tourists, the great moorlands which stretch away
to the north we found none the less interesting.</p>

<p>Chesterfield Church is famous for its distorted
spire, strangely twisted and leaning several degrees
from the vertical. Some say it was due to a whim
of the designer, but local legend prefers to ascribe
it to the malice of His Satanic Majesty, who chose
such queer ways of venting his spite on the churches
of olden time. If he indeed twisted Chesterfield&rsquo;s
spire, it was at least a far more obvious evidence
of his ill will toward churches than the scratch of
his claw still shown on the bell of St. Mary&rsquo;s at
Shrewsbury. But the troublesome antiquarians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
who have such a way of discrediting the painstaking
and very satisfactory work of the legend-makers,
would have us believe that the oaken timbers
of the spire warped while seasoning under
their coverings of lead. Be that as it may, Chesterfield
Church is worthy a few minutes&rsquo; pause on account
of its remarkable tombs and unusual screen mysteriously
carved with emblems of the crucifixion.
Less imposing is Trinity Church, though the white
marble tablet on its walls with the simple inscription,
&ldquo;George Stephenson, died August 12, 1848,
aged 68 years,&rdquo; will have a fascination for the wayfarer
from the remotest part of the earth, wherever
the steam railroad has penetrated. The great inventor
spent his declining years in retirement on a
farm about a mile from Chesterfield, and his house
still stands, partly hidden from the road by ancient
trees.</p>

<p>We had no desire to visit Chatsworth House
a second time, though we followed the much frequented
road through the park. No section of
rural England, possibly excepting the Stratford-upon-Avon
country is more favored by tourists; motors,
carriages and chars-a-bancs were everywhere
in evidence and stirred up clouds of limestone dust,
which whitened the trees and hedges and filled the
sky with a silvery haze. The number of English
visitors is greater than at Stratford, and the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
intelligent Englishman who has not visited Chatsworth
is rather the exception. A thousand visitors
a day is not uncommon; yet Chatsworth House is
thrown open free to all every week day&mdash;surely an
example of princely generosity on the part of the
Duke of Devonshire.</p>

<p>Few who visit Chatsworth will omit Haddon
Hall, and while a single visit to the modern palace
may suffice, a hundred to Haddon, it seemed to us,
would leave one still unsatisfied. Who could ever
weary of the indescribable beauty of the ancient
house or cease to delight in its atmosphere of romantic
story? Nowhere in England is there another
place that speaks so eloquently of the past or
which brings so near to our prosaic present day the
life, manners and environment of the English nobleman
of three or four centuries ago. No sight in
England is more enchanting than the straggling walls
and widely scattered towers of Haddon, standing
in gray outline against the green of its sheltering hill&mdash;the
point of view chosen by the painter of our
picture. Yet, with all its battlements and watch-towers,
Haddon was never a fortified castle&mdash;a circumstance
to which we owe its perfect preservation.
The wars of the Roses and the Commonwealth left
it scathless; it was an actual residence until 1730,
since which time every care has been exercised to
maintain it in repair. We will not rehearse the well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>known
legends of the place, nor will we give ear
for an instant to the insinuation that the romance of
the fair Dorothy was fabricated less than a hundred
years ago. What tinge of romance will be left to
this prosaic world if these busybody iconoclasts are
given heed? They cannot deny that Dorothy married
John Manners, Duke of Rutland, anyway, for
it was through this union that Haddon Hall passed
to its present owners.</p>

<p>After a long, loving look at her ancestral
home, we turn away and follow the dusty road to
Bakewell, where we stand before her tomb in the
fine old church. Here in effigy she kneels facing
her husband and below are the indescribably quaint
figures of her four children. The caretaker, who is
loudly lecturing a group of trippers, catches a
glimpse of us as we enter and his practical eye differentiates
instantly the American tourist. He hastens
to us and begs us to wait a little&mdash;the party is large&mdash;he
will soon give us his personal attention. The
trippers are hurried along and dismissed with scant
ceremony and we are shown about in detail that
encroaches upon our time. Still, there are many
things of genuine interest and antiquity in Bakewell
Church and the dissertations of our guide concerning
them is worth the half crown we bestow upon him.</p>

<p>Outside, we pause to contemplate the grand
old structure. Its massive walls terminate in cas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>tellated
battlements and its splendid spire, a miniature
of Salisbury, in slender yet graceful proportions,
rises to a height of two hundred feet. All around
is the spacious churchyard, thickly set with monumental
stones, and upon one of these we noted the
quaintest of the many quaint old English epitaphs
we read. Happy indeed the parish clerk immortalized
in the following couplets:</p>

<span class="i2">Till Angels wake thee with such notes as thine.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>From Bakewell we followed one of the many
Wyes to Buxton&mdash;a road scarcely equalled for
beauty in the Peak District. What a contrast its
wayside trees and flowers and pleasant farm cottages
presented to the stony moorland road we pursued
northward from Buxton! We lingered at the
latter place only enough to note the salient features
of the popular watering-place of the Peak. It is
situated in a verdant valley, but the moorland hills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
bleak and barren, nearly surround it. Only three miles
distant is Dovedale, famed as the loveliest and most
picturesque of the many English &ldquo;Dales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have no words cheerless enough to tell our
impressions of the great Midland Moor, through
whose very heart our way led to the northward.
A stony road through a gray, stony country with
a stone hovel here and there, tells something of the
story. We pass bleak little towns, climb many
steep, winding hills, speed swiftly along the uplands,
leaving a long trail of white dust-clouds in our wake&mdash;until
we are surprised by Glossop, a good-sized
city in the midst of the moor. It has large papermills,
substantially built of stone, an industry made
possible by the pure waters of the moor. The
streets are paved with rough cobble-stones and the
town has altogether a cheerless, unattractive look,
but interesting as quite a new phase of England.
In all our journeyings throughout the Kingdom we
found no section more utterly bleak and dreary than
that through which we passed from Buxton to Glossop.
We could but imagine what aspect a country
that so impressed us on a fine day in June time
must present in the dull, gray English winter.
How the unimpeded winds must sweep the brown
moorlands! How their icy blasts must search out
every crevice in the lone cottages and penetrate the
cheerless-looking hovels in the villages! A small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
native of whom we asked his recollection of winter
shook his head sadly and said, &ldquo;Awfully cold&rdquo;;
and a local proverb referring to the section has it
that &ldquo;Kinderscout is the cowdest place aout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sheffield road follows the hills, which
towered high above us at times or again dropped
almost sheer away below to a black, tumbling
stream. In one place, beneath an almost mountainous
hill, we had an adventure which startled us
more than any other occurrence of our tour. From
the summit of a hill hundreds of feet above us, some
miscreant loosened a huge boulder, which plunged
down the declivity seemingly straight at us, but by
good fortune missed our car by a few yards. The
perpetrator of the atrocity immediately disappeared
and there was no chance of tracing him. Happily,
we had no similar outrage to record of all our
twelve thousand miles in Britain, and we pass the
act as that of a criminal or lunatic. This road was
built about the beginning of the nineteenth century
and a competent authority expresses doubt if there is
a finer, better-engineered road in England than that
between Glossop and Ashopton, a village about
half way to Sheffield, and adds, &ldquo;or one where
houses are so rare&mdash;or the sight of an inn rouses
such pleasureable anticipation,&rdquo; though one of these,
&ldquo;The Snake,&rdquo; must have other attractions than its
name. It is indeed a fine road, though by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
unmatched by many others&mdash;the Manchester road
to the northwest fully equals it, and following as
it does the series of fine reservoirs lying in the valleys,
is superior in scenery.</p>

<p>We took a short cut through Sheffield, the
city of knives, razors and silver plate, caught a
second glimpse of Chesterfield&rsquo;s reeling spire, and
swept over the hills into Mansfield just as the long
twilight was fading into night.</p>

<p>The next morning our hostess of The Swan
placed in our hands the much-sought-for pass to
Newstead Abbey, and to while the time until the
hour set for admittance, we went by the way of
Hucknall, to visit Byron&rsquo;s grave in the church
whose square-topped tower dominates the town.
Recent restoration gives an air of newness, for Hucknall
Church, when Byron&rsquo;s remains were laid before
its altar, was little better than a ruin. The old man
working over the graves in the churchyard knew
full well our mission and leaving his task accosted
us in unmistakable Irish brogue. He led us directly
to the poet&rsquo;s tomb, and it was with deep feeling
not unmixed with awe that we advanced toward
the high altar of Hucknall Church and stood silent
and uncovered before the grave of Byron. On the
wall over the tomb were graven two of those passages
whose lofty sentiments glitter like gems&mdash;though
betimes in inharmonious setting&mdash;throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
poet&rsquo;s writings, which breathe the high hopes he
felt in his better moments. Well may the tablet
over his last resting-place bear the inspired lines:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;If that high world, which lies beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our own, surviving Love endears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there the cherish&rsquo;d heart be fond,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The eye the same, except in tears&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How welcome those untrodden spheres!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How sweet this very hour to die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To soar from earth and find all fears<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lost in thy light&mdash;Eternity!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;It must be so; &rsquo;tis not for self<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That we so tremble on the brink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, striving to o&rsquo;erleap the gulf,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet cling to Being&rsquo;s severing link.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! in that future let us think<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To hold each heart the heart that shares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With them the immortal waters drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And soul in soul grow deathless theirs!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The second quotation is from &ldquo;Childe Harold,&rdquo;
more positive in its tone, though less scintillating
in its verbiage. In the wall near by, the gift of a
Scotch admirer, is a marble profile medallion of the
poet&rsquo;s face, with Shelley&rsquo;s characterization, &ldquo;The
Pilgrim of Eternity.&rdquo; In the adjoining vestry the
walls are covered with the graven words of many
of the greatest men of the century&mdash;tributes to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
genius of Byron. Verily the church at Hucknall has
become as a mausoleum to one denied burial in
the nation&rsquo;s Valhalla, and who was, in truth, almost
grudged sepulture in his native soil by a large number
of the Englishmen of his day. And there came
to us a faint conception of the intense bitterness of
the times&mdash;when the body of England&rsquo;s greatest
genius, dead in a forlorn but glorious cause, was
brought to his native land to be greeted with a
storm of hatred and a fierce protest against interment
in Westminster Abbey. With little ceremony he
was laid away in the church of Hucknall and pilgrims
now come daily to that otherwise uninteresting
and rather ugly town to do honor to the memory
of Byron&mdash;certainly one of the brightest and most
fascinating, if not the greatest, of English poets.</p>

<p>For me there was none other of the historic
places which we visited more deeply tinged by its
romantic associations or possessing a greater fascination
than Newstead Abbey. Perhaps this feeling
was intensified by our previous unsuccessful attempts
to gain admission and by the recollection of the
passion of my boyhood days for the verse of Byron&mdash;though
indeed I have hardly read him latterly.
But we were to visit Newstead at last. If we
found a little difficulty&mdash;possibly the result of our
ignorance&mdash;in getting permission, we could not complain
of the opportunities afforded us as visitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>From the Mansfield road we entered the gateway
and drove through the stretches of forest and
meadow in the great park, halting the car at the
very doorway of the ancient place. We paused to
view the fine facade, with its square battlemented
tower at one end and the ruins of the abbey church
at the other. There is little left of this latter save
the east wall, once pierced by three great windows,
two of which have at some time been filled in. We
were conducted by the rather aristocratic housekeeper
to every part of the house save the private
apartments of the family, and there was no effort
to hurry us along&mdash;so often the fate of the tourist
in such cases.</p>

<p>One who is accustomed to think of Newstead
Abbey as it lives, lonely and half ruinous, in the
verse of Byron, who had such an intense affection
for the home of his ancestors; or even one who
reads Washington Irving&rsquo;s interesting account of
his visit to the place when owned by Col. Wildman
a few years later, is hardly prepared for the modern
palace into which the abbey has been transformed.
The paneled halls, with their rich furnishings and
rare curios from all parts of the world, and the trim,
beautifully kept gardens that greet one everywhere
from the windows, have little in common with the
Newstead of which Byron wrote in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>&ldquo;Hours of
Idleness:&rdquo;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Through thy battlements, Newstead, the hollow winds whistle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou, the hall of my fathers, art gone to decay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thy once smiling garden, the hemlock and thistle<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have choked up the rose which once bloomed in the way.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Still, much is unaltered and there are many relics to
bring memories of the one-time noble, though unfortunate,
owner, whose recklessness quite as much
as his necessities compelled the sale of his ancestral
estate.</p>

<div class="center">
<a name="bw_21" id="bw_21"></a><img src="images/bw_21.jpg" width="600" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NEWSTEAD ABBEY.</p>
</div>

<p>Of greatest interest are the apartments which
Byron himself occupied, a suite of three medium-sized
rooms, which have been religiously kept
through all the years just as the poet left them.
The simple blue and white toilet set was his own,
the bed the one he slept in, and many other articles
and furnishings vividly recall the noble occupant
who never returned after the sale of the abbey.
Probably no one has occupied the rooms since
Washington Irving slept there during the visit we
have referred to and was roused in the middle of
the night by a ghostly footfall in the hall&mdash;but
found only Boatswain II. outside the door.</p>

<p>In the hall the marks of the pistol shots of the
young lord and his wild companions have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
effaced from the walls and in the gallery there is
a collection of many mementos of the poet. Perhaps
the most interesting is a section of the tree upon
which he carved his name and that of his sister,
Augusta&mdash;cut down because it was decaying.
The gallery is largely filled with portraits of the
present family, but our interest centers in the famous
portrait by Phillips, in which the refined features
and dignified though slightly melancholy air has invested
the poet&rsquo;s face with a spirituality which it
probably did not possess in so great a degree.</p>

<p>From the house we were ushered into the
gardens and were shown every nook and corner of
these by the gardener in charge. They were elaborate
indeed; rich with the color and perfume of the
flowers which bloom so profusely in England; and
there were many rare plants and shrubs. We were
interested in Boatswain&rsquo;s grave, with its elaborate
monument and inscription in which pathos verges
on the ridiculous, yet highly consistent with the misanthropic
moods so often affected by Byron. In
contrast with the trim neatness of the flower beds
and shrubbery is the fragment of the abbey church,
through which the wind whistles as it did in the
poet&rsquo;s day, and which has weathered the sun and
rain of more than three hundred years since the
heavy hand of the eighth Henry smote it into ruins.
And it carries us back four hundred years farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to another Henry, who built the abbey to expiate
his crime of instigating the murder of Thomas
a&rsquo;Becket.</p>

<p>The history of Newstead told in brief by
Irving need not occupy space in this hasty chronicle.
It was with reluctance that we departed after our
two hours&rsquo; sojourn. It often comes back in memory
with all the color and glory of a perfect June day&mdash;the
majestic hall, the abbey ruin, the gardens with
their riot of coloring, the shining lake, the woodland
and the meadows&mdash;an enchanted world which we
left behind us as we hastened away over the road
to Mansfield, where we had late luncheon at the
Swan.</p>

<p>One will not leave the vicinity of Mansfield
without a visit to Hardwick Hall and Bolsover
Castle, famous for their connection with Elizabeth
Spencer, &ldquo;Bess of Hardwick.&rdquo; Architecturally,
both are disappointing; Hardwick, bald, harsh
and square, like a modern concrete factory, and
Bolsover, an incongruous pile cut up into small, ill-arranged
apartments, by far the finest part of it in
complete ruin. Hardwick is still a residence of the
Duke of Devonshire and had just passed on the
death of Spencer Cavendish to his nephew, who
was refurnishing the house preparatory to making
it his home. A bare, unhomelike place it seemed,
with its great staring windows, its uneven concrete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
floors, and its high ceilings of decorated plaster,
broken and discolored in many places. Its chief
historical interest centers in the fact that it was one
of the many prison-houses of Mary Stuart; but her
imprisonment here was far from rigorous&mdash;in fact,
so considerate was the Earl of Shrewsbury of his
royal ward that it roused the jealousy of his amiable
spouse, the energetic Bess. Concerning this incident
Miss Strickland&mdash;a rather biased historian, we must
fear&mdash;takes the countess to task in vigorous style, declaring
that&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His proud and cruel wife, whose temper
could not be restrained by any power on earth or
in heaven, soon became jealous of the lovely and
fascinating prisoner, and led her husband, a noble
of exemplary gravity and a grandsire, a terrible life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, as in nearly every case of the kind,
there appears to have been another side to it, and in
any event, there were many who took the part of
the jealous wife, including, as might be expected,
Queen Elizabeth herself.</p>

<p>The countess, besides Hardwick Hall, built
the former house at Chatsworth, which has since
been torn down. Bolsover was completed by her
son; it is now unoccupied but maintained in good
repair. It is worth a visit rather for the fine view
from its towers&mdash;for it occupies a most magnificent
site on a high promontory overlooking the wide vale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of the river&mdash;than for any interest the castle itself
possesses.</p>

<p>The sun had sunk low when we came down
from the castle walls and started for York, sixty
miles away. At Worksop we were clear of the
byways and the open road, invitingly smooth and
level and almost free from traffic, stretched out
before us. This chronicle is no record of miles per
hour, and the motor enters into it only as a means
to an end; yet there is no harm in saying that we
had few swifter, evener flights through a more
charming country than that which fleeted past us
between Worksop and York. We soon caught
sight of Doncaster&rsquo;s dominating church tower, a
fit mate for many of the cathedrals, but in our haste
out of the town we missed the North Road and
were soon noting the milestones to Tadcaster,
famous for little else than its ales. The North Road
is a trifle better in surface and a little more direct,
but we had traversed it before and did not regret
the opportunity of seeing a different country. The
minster towers soon loomed dim in the purple light
and we felt a sense of almost homelike restfulness
when we were established at the Station Hotel&mdash;to
our notion one of the two or three most comfortable
in England.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X">X</a><br />
FROM YORKSHIRE COAST TO BARNARD CASTLE</h2>

<p>The Minster of St. John of Beverley is easily
the finest single example of Perpendicular architecture
in England; in beauty and majesty of design,
in proportion and in general effect&mdash;from almost
any viewpoint&mdash;there is no more pleasing church
in the Kingdom. We come in sight of its graceful
twin towers while yet afar from the town, after a
thirty-mile run from York through some of the most
prosperous farming country in the shire. As we
come nearer, the mass of red tiles, from which rises
the noble bulk of the minster, resolves itself into
the houses of the old town, whose ancient heart has
lost none of its charm in the little city which has
more recently grown up around it.</p>

<p>As we emerge from a narrow street bordered
with mean little houses, the great church suddenly
bursts on our view and we pause to admire its vast
yet perfect proportions, its rich carvings, and the
multitude of graceful pinnacles. We enter, but the
caretaker receives us with little enthusiasm, though
at our request he shows us about in a rather reserved
manner. A card on the wall explains mat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ters:
&ldquo;Positively no fees to attendants.&rdquo; Our experience
has been that such a notice means cash in
advance if you are to have the attention you want
and which you really need if you are to see and
appreciate such a church. We proceed, therefore,
to get on a proper footing with our guide, and begin
forthwith to learn the history, the architecture, the
curiosities and the gossip of Beverley Minster. And
the last is not the least interesting, for here, as at
Wymondham, was a rector who with the modest
salary of four hundred pounds a year had spent many
thousands of his own money in restoration and repair
of the minster. He had restored the intricate
screen and replaced some of the images which had
been broken up, yet so cleverly was the toning and
coloring done that the newer work could not be
distinguished from the old.</p>

<p>The St. John from whom the minster took its
name was Archbishop of York and founded a
church on the present site in the sixth century. He
died in 731 and, tradition says, is buried in the
minster. But Beverley&rsquo;s most distinguishing historic
fact is that it was one of the three &ldquo;sanctuaries of
refuge&rdquo; in England. Here, by the strange edict
of the early church, any criminal who could evade
his pursuers might take refuge in the precincts of
Beverley Minster and for thirty days be entitled to
the protection and hospitality of the monks, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
which he was given a passport to sail from the
nearest port to some foreign land. We saw the
rude stone chair of &ldquo;refuge&rdquo; to which no doubt
many a gasping scoundrel clung, safe, for the time,
from justice by virtue of his ability to outrun his
pursuers. One incident is recorded of a &ldquo;Tailour
of York&rdquo; who had cruelly murdered his wife but
who escaped punishment by taking refuge in Beverley.
The only penalty inflicted was to brand the
criminal on the thumb with a hot iron and to watch
him closely until he sailed for France. However,
all this was better than being hanged, the penalty
freely administered by the civil authorities in those
days, and as a consequence Beverley always had
a large number of &ldquo;undesirable citizens&rdquo; within her
borders.</p>

<p>There is much else of interest in the minster,
though we may not linger over its attractions save
to mention the Percy tomb, reputed the finest in
Europe&mdash;and indeed, its rare marbles and delicate
sculptures must represent a princely fortune. Nor
could we have more than a passing glimpse of St.
Mary&rsquo;s Church, second only to the minster in importance,
for Beverley is the only town in England
of anywhere near its size that has the distinction of
possessing two churches of really the first magnitude.</p>

<p>Following the road from Beverley to the coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
by Great Driffield and Bridlington, we had a
glimpse near the latter place of the high cliff of Flamborough
Head, from which the startled Yorkshiremen
of a century or more ago saw the &ldquo;pirate,&rdquo;
John Paul Jones, win his ever memorable victory
over the Serapis. It is not a subject even to this day
which the natives can discuss with entire equanimity.</p>

<p>The road closely follows the coast to Scarborough,
the queen of Yorkshire watering-places.
We caught frequent glimpses of the ocean, which,
once out of the shadows of the towering cliffs,
stretched away until its deep&mdash;almost metallic&mdash;blue
faded against the silvery horizon. We soon
found ourselves on the handsome main street of the
new town, which brought us to the waterfront at
the foot of castle hill. An old man approached us,
seeing our hesitation, and informed us that the new
road around the promontory, one of the finest drives
in England, was open&mdash;not officially open, to be
sure, and it would not be until some of the &ldquo;Nobs&rdquo;
came and the ceremonies of a formal dedication
were performed. The road had been cut in the
almost sheer side of the cliff, a broad driveway overlooking
the varied scenery of coast and ocean&mdash;the
latter now as mild and softly shimmering as a quiet
inland lake. One could only imagine, on such a
day, how the sea must rage and thunder against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the promontory in wild weather, and we learned
that storms interfered much with the building of the
road, one of them causing damage estimated at fifty
thousand pounds. But Scarborough persevered
and the splendid driveway had just been completed.
Later we had the satisfaction of learning from the
newspapers that the Princess of Wales had visited
Scarborough for the express purpose of formally
dedicating the road with all the ceremony so dear
to the English.</p>

<p>Scarborough is unique in its combination of
the old and the modern; but few of its rivals can
boast of a castle with a history reaching back to
the wars with the Danish invaders. Brighton and
Eastbourne, sometimes ranked with Scarborough,
are quite recent and lack the distinction that comes
of centuries. Scarborough Castle, perched on its
mighty rock, still presents a formidable appearance
and impresses one with the tremendous strength its
situation and heavy walls gave it before gunpowder
brought such things to naught. From the keep
tower a far-reaching prospect lies beneath us; a
panorama of the sea chafing on the broken coast,
and to the landward are the barren moors that encircle
the town. There is not much of the fortress
left, but the fragments are carefully guarded from
decay and in places have been somewhat restored.
There is a museum near the entrance to the keep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
with a miscellaneous collection of relics, more or
less gruesome, unearthed about the town and castle.</p>

<p>Few indeed are the places which bring back
more delightful memories or a greater longing to
return than Whitby&mdash;old, straggling, storm-beaten
Whitby&mdash;climbing up its steep hill crowned by
one of the most unique churches and stateliest abbey
ruins in all Britain. The road which takes us from
Scarborough to its ancient rival is a wild one, wandering
around the black, heather-splotched hills with
trying grades which make careful driving necessary.
To the right the ocean still shimmers in the setting
sun and in nooks on the coast we catch glimpses of
fishing villages&mdash;among them Robin Hood&rsquo;s Bay,
called by some the most picturesque of the smaller
fishing-towns in England. Long before we come
into Whitby we catch sight of the skeleton of the
abbey on the headland, standing almost weirdly
against the evening sky. We descend a long, winding
hill and find ourselves threading our way through
crooked, narrow streets thronged with people who
get out of the way only when they have to. Passing
between rows of old houses crowding closely
on either hand, we cross the bridge over the inlet
and ascend the sharp hill where the hotels face the
town and abbey on the opposite cliff. Thither we
wend our way after dinner, just as the daylight
begins to fade, and passing through the devious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
streets thronged with fisher folk and dirty youngsters,
we ascend the ninety-nine broad stone steps by
which one reaches the headland.</p>

<p>The ruin is deserted and we find ourselves sole
possessors of Whitby Abbey at an hour when the
twilight softens the outlines and touches with gray
and purple hues the old town at our feet and the
rough moorland hills in the background, while the
wide expanse of ocean glows mysteriously from the
reflection of the dim-lit skies. The ruin rises
abruptly from the soft greensward upon which the
cows are contentedly grazing, and near at hand,
gleaming darkly in the fading light, lies the fish pool,
which lends much to the picturesqueness of the surroundings.
The great church has fallen into complete
ruin; decay is riot everywhere. Only half a
century ago the central tower crashed to the earth,
carrying many arches and pillars with it, and huge
fragments of masonry still lie scattered about as if
fallen from some thunder-riven cliff.</p>

<p>Whitby Abbey is rich in legend, and at such
an hour we will trouble ourselves little about sober
fact&mdash;let mystery wrap the ruin even as the mantle
of gathering darkness; for us it shall be only the
&ldquo;High Whitby&rsquo;s cloistered pile&rdquo; of romance. We
pass outside the abbey confines and pause before
St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, a long squat building with low
tower, as bald and plain as the abbey is pretentious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
and ornate. It was built as a rival to the abbey
church in a very early day when there were bickerings
between the townspeople and the monks of
Whitby. In the churchyard, thick with mouldering
memorials, has lately been raised a Saxon cross,
inscribed to the memory of Caedmon, Father of
English Letters, who &ldquo;fell asleep hard by A. D.
680.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">WHITBY ABBEY AND CROSS.</p>
</div>

<p>As we return to our hotel, we are attracted
into one of the old-town shops by a display of old
brass and silver, and the genial proprietor at once
establishes a basis of community, for has he not been
in the States and has he not a brother there now?
We pick up an antique lantern with dingy horn doors
and green with verdigris and try the stale joke,
&ldquo;Made in Birmingham,&rdquo; which once or twice has
brought a storm of indignant protest on our heads.
But it does not so excite our Yorkshire friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I had a dozen copies made of
a very rare piece that came into my hands. And
that accounts for the price&mdash;genuine antiques are so
rare and so sought for that the original would cost
you many times the copy&mdash;and after all, you would
be no better off when you had it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We cannot resist such confidence and add further
to our burden of oddities such as one gathers,
willy nilly, in a tour of the nooks and corns. Whitby
shops are full of jet ornaments&mdash;brooches, beads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
bracelets, and a thousand and one fanciful things&mdash;for
jet is mined near the town,&mdash;a smooth lustrous
substance whose name has come to signify the final
degree of blackness.</p>

<p>On the following day we again wander about
the old-world streets of the town, which we find
ourselves loath to leave. The morning&rsquo;s catch is
just in at the fish-market and the finny tribes of all
degrees are sorted on the pavement and sold to the
townspeople. The fishing industry of Whitby is
now on a small scale only; in former days it constituted
a source of some wealth. The ballad writer
celebrating Robin Hood&rsquo;s visit to Whitby gives this

<p>And thus the sturdy highwayman found it easy to
replenish his exchequer from the fat purses of
Whitby folk. It may be, though, that the isolated
situation of the town between the wild moors and
the sea, and its good harbor for small vessels, made
the occupation of smuggling especially profitable,
and the wealth of the old-time citizens of Whitby
may have been augmented by this practice.</p>

</div>

<p>Our route out of the town led through the
Cleveland Hills, the roughest and loneliest of the
Yorkshire moors. We climbed many steep, rugged
hills and dropped down sharp, dangerous slopes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
one will hardly find elsewhere in England a country
scored more deeply by narrow valleys. There is little
of life on the twenty-five miles of road to Guisborough,
where one comes out of the moor into
the wide valley of the Tees. Guisborough is a
bleak little town whose beautiful surroundings have
been marred by the mines. Of its ancient priory,
there remains only the magnificent eastern wall,
pierced nearly to the top by tall lancet windows
from which the stone tracery has long since vanished.
It stands in a wide meadow, half hidden
by giant trees. As we glided along the highroad
we caught glimpses of the wall, rising from a stretch
of velvety lawn, but there was not enough of the
ruin to make a nearer inspection worth while.</p>

<p>From Guisborough our road ran through a
level, fertile farming country. We missed Middlesbrough,
a manufacturing city of one hundred thousand,
whose array of factory chimneys loomed up
thickly across the fields, and soon came into Stockton-on-Tees,
about half the size of its neighbor.
It lies directly on the river, here a black, turbid
stream, sullied by the factories that crowd its banks.
We hesitated entering the Black Lion&mdash;it had an
uncanny look that made us distrust even the infallible
Baedeker. No one except the busy barmaids was
to be seen. A few glances about the place confirmed
our suspicions and we <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>&ldquo;silently stole away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a contrast to the Black Lion we found
in its next-door neighbor, the Vane Arms, a fine
type of the hospitable old-time English inn. Its
massive, richly carved furniture would delight the
heart of the connoisseur and is the pride of the
stately landlady, who sat at the head of the table
and treated us as though we were guests in more
than the perfunctory hotel parlance. In the desert
of daily hotel life one does not easily forget such
an oasis as the Vane Arms. It is the only thing
I can think of that might make one wish to linger
in Stockton-on-Tees.</p>

<p>The road to Darlington is excellent, though
sinuous, and we found in that bustling city little
evidence of the antiquity vouched for by its twelfth
century church. It is now a railway center and
has been since the first passenger train in England
ran over the Darlington &amp; Stockton Railway in
1825. In going to Barnard Castle we proceeded
by the way of Staindrop, though the direct road by
the Tees is the best. But the route we chose passes
Raby Castle, which burst on our view shortly before
we reached Staindrop,&mdash;a huge gray pile, half
fortress, half palace, with many square battlemented
towers and crenelated turrets, all combining to fulfill
the very ideal of the magnificence of feudal days.</p>

<p>Permission to visit the castle was easily gained
from the estate agent at Staindrop. It would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
hard to imagine anything more imposing than Raby
Castle as we saw it on that perfect July day, its
vast bulk massed against the green background of
the wooded hills, and in front of it a fine lawn,
with many giant elms, stretching down to the road;
but does not our picture tell more than any words?
We noted that few of the great private parks which
we had visited were so beautifully kept or had so
much to please and attract; the great trees, the lawnlike
sward, the little blue lakes, the herds of tawny
deer&mdash;all combined to form a setting fit for one of
the proudest and best preserved of the ancient homes
of England.</p>

<p>The castle dates from the thirteenth century.
By fortunate chance it escaped the ravages of war,
and having been continuously occupied&mdash;indeed,
there is a legend that its hearth-fire has never died
out in five hundred years&mdash;it is one of the most perfect
examples of its type in England. The exterior
has not been greatly altered, but inside it has
been much modernized and transformed into a palatial
and richly furnished residence. In the library
is a collection of costly books; the gallery has many
rare portraits and pictures; and scattered about the
different apartments are many valuable objects of
art, among these the famous marble, &ldquo;The Greek
Slave,&rdquo; by Powers, the American sculptor.</p>

<p>Least altered of all is the medieval kitchen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
which occupies the base of a large tower and is
one of the most interesting features of the castle.
Its immense size serves to impress upon one the
proportions of feudal hospitality&mdash;that the lord of
the castle must look above everything else to the
good cheer of his guests. But there is a touch of
modernism here, too, in the iron ranges which have
superseded the great fireplace&mdash;perhaps thirty feet
in width&mdash;of former times.</p>

<p class="caption">RABY CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Raby cannot greatly boast of historic events,
yet it is interesting to know that it was once the home
of the younger Sir Henry Vane, who was governor
of the colony of Massachusetts Bay in 1636. It
was built by the Nevilles in 1370, but passed to
other hands two hundred years later, when that
family took part in the Catholic uprising in the
north. But after all, Raby is far more interesting
as a survival of the &ldquo;days of roselight and romance&rdquo;
than would be the story of the tenure of this or that
forgotten lord or earl.</p>

<p>Barnard Castle takes its name from the ancient
fortress whose scanty ruin still looms over the
town. It stands on a cliff which drops from the
castle wall almost sheer to the shallow Tees beneath.
One thinks first of Dickens&rsquo; association with
the town and naturally enough hastens to the King&rsquo;s
Head, where the novelist&rsquo;s room is still shown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Master Humphrey&rsquo;s clock, which adorned a building
just opposite the hotel, has disappeared&mdash;purchased
by an American, a native told us with a
shade of indignation in his voice&mdash;but the town itself
is little different from the one Dickens knew.
He gained here much material for &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo;
though at Bowes, high on the moor to the
westward, is supposed to have been the original of
Dotheboys Hall.</p>

<p>The King&rsquo;s Head we found a comfortable,
well-managed, old-time inn, an excellent headquarters
for excursions to the many interesting points
of the vicinity. We reached here early in the afternoon,
affording us time for a fifteen-mile jaunt up
the Tees Valley to the High Force&mdash;they call a
waterfall the &ldquo;force&rdquo; in Yorkshire&mdash;the largest cataract
in England, we were told. It is situated in
a lovely dell, and while the flood of white water
pouring over the jagged cliff into the brown boiling
lake below is pretty and striking, it has nothing
awe inspiring or majestic about it. True, at the time,
the Tees was at lowest ebb; a long drouth had reduced
it to a fourth its normal volume and of course
we did not see the High Force at its best. Every
spot of interest in the Kingdom has its inn and it was
in the farmyard of the High Force Hotel that we
left the car. On returning from the falls, a deflated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
tire prolonged our stay, encouraging acquaintance
with the hotel people. The landlord, who out of
the hotel season was apparently a farmer, became
friendly and communicative, especially desiring us
to deliver a message to his son, whom he seemed to
think we might easily locate in America. Then he
led us into the hotel, where a framed page from his
visitors&rsquo; book showed that the Princess Ena&mdash;now
Queen Victoria of Spain&mdash;and members of her suite
had been guests at the High Force Hotel. The two
great events in the old man&rsquo;s life seemed to be the
success that he considered his son was making in
the States and the royal visit to his inn. I do not
know which gave him the greater satisfaction.</p>

<p>We returned to Barnard Castle following the
road north of the Tees&mdash;we had come to Middleton
on the south side of the river&mdash;and we had an almost
continual view of the winding stream and its
pleasantly diversified valley. It was a peaceful
rural landscape, glimmering in the twilight&mdash;the
silver thread of the river running through it&mdash;that
greeted our view during our swift flight along the upland
road.</p>

<p>It was the end of a rather trying day and it
seemed hardly possible that we had sojourned in
Old Whitby only the night before&mdash;so different was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the scene and so varied our experiences; still, the
distance in miles is not great. The restful quiet of
the King&rsquo;s Head and its well-served dinner were
indeed a welcome close to the wanderings of the
day.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI</a><br />
LAKELAND AND THE YORKSHIRE DALES</h2>

<p>During a tour such as ours one becomes impressed
that a large proportion of Britain is in barren
moorlands or broken hills suitable only for sheep
grazing&mdash;an impression made all the stronger by the
diminutive size of the country. We in America
can better afford our vast tracts of waste land; we
have fertile river valleys from which dozens of Englands
might be carved; but it seems almost melancholy
that at least a third of the Kingdom, no greater
in size than an average American state, should be
almost as irreclaimable as the Sahara. One does
not so much note this waste in railway travel, for
the steam roads usually follow the valleys and lowlands,
always green and prosperous, and naturally
seek out the more populous centers. But the wagon
road climbed steep hills and wended its way into
many retired sections where the steam engine cannot
profitably go, and the motor car has opened to
tourists a hitherto almost unexplored country.</p>

<p>We were early away for Lakeland, and for
miles and miles we traversed a rather inferior road
through the moors and fells. Four or five miles out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of Barnard Castle we passed through Bowes, a typical
Yorkshire moorland town stretching some distance
along the highroad. Though otherwise uninteresting
enough, Bowes has one distinction of which
it is far from proud, for here Charles Dickens found
the school which served as the prototype of Dotheboys
Hall in &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby.&rdquo; The building,
altered into a tenement house and its evil reputation
disguised under the more pleasing name of &ldquo;The
Villa,&rdquo; still stands at the western end of the town.
In Dickens&rsquo; day it was known as Shaw&rsquo;s School,
and it seems that it deserved far less than many
others of its class the overwhelming odium cast upon
it in &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby&rdquo;; and it is said that there
still are people in Bowes who chafe at the injustice
done their old-time townsman. But even if the
Bowes school suffered some injustice, the purpose
of Dickens was accomplished none the less in the
reformation of the terrible juvenile workhouses which
masqueraded as &ldquo;schools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moorland road carries us onward to
Brough, a shabby, desolate town deep in the hills,
with scarcely a touch of color to lighten its gray
monotone. But this decayed village has its traditions;
it was once famous through all England for
its annual horse fair. They tell us that the fair is
still held in Brough, though its fame has long since
declined and it is now of only local interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>At Appleby we enter the vale of the Eden,
and bounding the western horizon we catch the
first glimpse of the blue hills in whose deep depressions
lie the English lakes. Appleby has a comfortable
hotel, where we pause for lunch, and the
appearance of the town is better and more prosperous
than those we have recently passed. The
square tower of the castle rises from an adjacent
height and the church presents the remarkable spectacle
of a hair dresser&rsquo;s rooms occupying a portion
of the ancient cloisters which open on the market
place.</p>

<p>There is no finer highway in the north of England
than the Carlisle road through Penrith. It
pursues nearly if not quite the course of the old
Roman road following the lowlands along the river&mdash;a
broad white way which leads through a pleasant
succession of fields and villages. We pass many
ancient landmarks&mdash;on the left Brougham Castle,
a red sandstone ruin splashed with ivy and creepers,
and farther on to the right, Eden Hall, made famous
by the ballad of Uhland.</p>

<p>Penrith is a busy town of ten thousand or
more, seemingly improved since our visit of four
years before, when it had no electric light plant. It
is the starting-point for most Lake District excursions,
whether by rail or coach. The railway follows
the wagon road quite closely to Keswick and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
from thence one must have some other conveyance
than rail to explore the region. And is it not
well enough, for what impression worth while could
one gain of Lakeland from a railway car?</p>

<p>From Keswick we turn southward over the
hills, from whose summits the landscape&mdash;every hill
and vale redolent with music and memories of the
&ldquo;Lakers&rdquo;&mdash;stretches away beneath us, the lakes set
in the valleys like great flashing gems. How familiar
the odd names have been made by the poets of
Lakeland! Skiddaw, Helvellyn, Borrowdale,
Langdale Pikes and Fells, Rydal, Grasmere, and
a hundred others&mdash;all call to mind the stanzas of
Southey, Coleridge, and Wordsworth.</p>

<p>Our road sweeps up and down the hills along
the sinuous shores of Thirlmere, certainly one of the
most picturesque of the bright sisterhood of English
lakes, but which now serves the very practical
purpose of a source of water-supply for the city of
Manchester, which acquired it by purchase. This
transaction has aroused the indignation of a modern
lake poet who falls little short of the best traditions
of his illustrious predecessors and he makes vigorous
protest against the cities whose &ldquo;million-throated
thirst&rdquo; menaces the &ldquo;sacred meres&rdquo; of Lakeland.
But the Manchester ownership&mdash;prosaic as it may
be&mdash;has not detracted from the beauty of Thirlmere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
and many nuisances that once encumbered its shores
have been abated.</p>

<p>But the human interest of the lakes centers
around Grasmere and Rydal Water. Perchance
Rydal and Grasmere and Dove Cottage are out of
place in a chronicle of unfamiliar England, and yet
who could write of the Lake District with no reference
to the very attractions that have made it most
famous? It is late as we pass the quaint old church
&ldquo;with bald bare tower&rdquo; and pause at the cottage
just off the highroad, where Wordsworth passed so
many years in humble state that verged closely on
poverty, as one would count it now. There is little
of the picturesque in the gray-stone slate-roofed cottage,
though the diamond-paned windows and the
rose vines climbing to the eaves somewhat relieve
the monotony of the square walls and the rude stone
fence just in front. Like Shakespeare&rsquo;s house, it is
now the property of an association which insures its
preservation in memory of the poet. It has been
restored as nearly as possible to the same condition
as during the occupancy of the Wordsworths, and
the collection of books and other relics pertaining to
them is being constantly increased.</p>

<p>It is easy for us to enter into the daily life
of the poet as we pass through the small and rather
rudely furnished rooms; and one must indeed be
totally lacking in poetic instinct if he cannot feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
at least a touch of sympathy with the pleasant surroundings
so often the theme of the great
laureate of the simple life. We sit in the rustic
seat which Wordsworth was wont to occupy and
can look over the gray roof of the cottage to the
long succession of hills stretching away until
their blue outlines are silhouetted against the sunset
sky&mdash;verily an inspiration even to the most matter-of-fact
intellect. We know that much of Wordsworth&rsquo;s
best work was composed in the little garden
to the rear of the cottage&mdash;a bit of earth that
he loved with an intensity that has found more than
one expression in his written words. And it was
of the very seat upon which we sit that he wrote:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Beneath these fruit tree boughs that shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their snow-white blossoms on my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brightest sunshine round me spread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of spring&rsquo;s unclouded weather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this sequestered nook how sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sit upon my orchard seat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And birds and flowers once more to greet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My last year&rsquo;s friends together.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But to know more of the simple, happy life
at Dove Cottage, one may read from the letter written
by Dorothy in 1800:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are daily more delighted with Grasmere
and its neighborhood. Our walks are perpetually
varied, and we are more fond of the mountains as
our acquaintance with them increases. We have
a boat upon the lake, and a small orchard and smaller
garden, which, as it is the work of our own hands,
we regard with pride and partiality. Our cottage is
quite large enough for us, though very small; and
we have made it neat and comfortable within doors;
and it looks very nice on the outside; for though
the roses and honeysuckles which we have planted
against it are only of this year&rsquo;s growth, yet it is
covered all over with green leaves and scarlet flowers;
for we have trained scarlet beans upon threads,
which are not only exceedingly beautiful but very
useful, as their produce is immense. We have made
a lodging-room of the parlor below stairs, which
has a stone floor, therefore we have covered it all
over with matting. We sit in a room above stairs,
and we have one lodging-room with two single beds,
a sort of lumber-room, and a small low unceiled
room, which I have papered with newspapers, and
in which we have put a small bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But come! We may not stop at Dove Cottage
for the night; it would now offer but sorry
cheer, and Windermere seems the most available
place to tarry. We pass close to the water&rsquo;s edge
along Grasmere, and Rydal brings up new associations
of the poet&mdash;here on the &ldquo;Mount&rdquo; overlooking
the tiny lake is the house where Wordsworth lived
in his later and more prosperous years, still the home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
of his granddaughter, we are told. But the tripper
is not welcome and the envious tangle of trees and
shrubbery denies to the wayfarer even a glimpse of
the house.</p>

<p>The beautiful situation of the Lowwood Hotel
attracts our attention as we follow the margin of
the lake, but we pass on in our swift race for Windermere.
Coming thither we inquire of a policeman
in the market place for the best hotel. He is
diplomatic enough to disclaim fitness to judge, but
adds confidentially, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make no mistake if you
go to the Hold Hengland; that&rsquo;s where the quality
goes.&rdquo; We thank him&mdash;praise Heaven that is all
one is expected to do, or in fact, may do for a policeman
in Britain!&mdash;but when we view the Old
England we are seized with regret that we passed
Lowwood with its magnificent frontage on the lake.
It is nothing to retrace the half dozen miles to the
most pretentious hotel in the Lake District, though
probably far from the most comfortable, and certainly
anything but the place for travelers of an
economical turn. What motorist could forget or
forgive the charge of half a crown for simple garage&mdash;two
and one-half times the standard price in England!
Still, the view of the lake from Lowwood
as the evening falls compensates for many shortcomings.
The twilight has transformed the limpid
waters into a sheet of dull silver, touched with faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
rose hues from the last glow of the sun. The hills
beyond stand in dark blue outline against a pale
opalescent sky and the dim gray towers of Wray
Castle rear their massive bulk in the foreground.
There is no more enchanting view from the shores
of Windermere Lake and we saw it under the most
favorable conditions.</p>

<p>A sharp change has come over the scene when
we resume our journey in the morning. A light
rain is falling and the mist hovering over the lake
half hides the distant hills. Gray tones predominate
everywhere, contrasting cheerlessly with the brilliance
of the preceding day. But such a day may
be looked for as the rule rather than the exception,
for the rainfall of the Lake District is much the
heaviest in England. We pass Ambleside at the
head of the lake, and follow the steep, ill-kept road,
slippery from the rain, to Coniston, a very quiet village,
nestling at the foot of the great hills at the head
of Coniston Water. In the churchyard here John
Ruskin was laid to rest&mdash;a Celtic cross marks the
spot&mdash;and a museum in the town contains many
of his sketches and manuscripts. The road southward
closely follows Coniston Water, though with
many slight but sharp undulations, winding through
a dense growth of young trees. We pass directly
under Brantwood, the plain old house where Ruskin
lived, and catch glimpses of the oriel window of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
leaded glass in which he was wont to sit at his work.
The house is situated on a wooded hillside and commands
a fine view of the lake. The road from
Brantwood to the end of the lake is so narrow, so
tortuous and so obscured by the trees that extreme
caution is necessary. It is still early and the way is
quite clear; we experience no trouble, yet we are
glad indeed to get into the main road to Dalton and
Ulverston.</p>

<p>Furness Abbey, once neglected and rather inaccessible,
has more recently become one of the best
known and most easily reached of the historic spots
of northern England. Among the multifarious activities
of the late Duke of Devonshire, was the
building of the railroad that leads to Barrow-in-Furness
and the development of that town into an
important port of sixty thousand inhabitants. A
few miles north of the town are the extensive ruins
of Furness Abbey, a Cistercian foundation of the
twelfth century, situated in a narrow valley underneath
overshadowing hills from which the red sandstone
used in the building was taken. The keen
business sense of the duke recognized in this splendid
ruin a decided factor to assist in his plan of development.
The grounds surrounding the abbey
were converted into a handsome park, a station was
opened on the railroad just opposite, and a large
hotel was built near by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Furness Abbey, however, carefully groomed
and in charge of voluble guides posted in the minutest
detail of architecture and history, can hardly impress
one as it did when, a lonely and crumbling
ruin, it was the goal of only the infrequent visitor.
Its story is a long one but of interest only to the
specialist or antiquarian. To the layman the tales
of the different abbeys seem wonderfully alike:
founded in religious zeal, a period of penury, then
of prosperity, and finally one of great power and affluence.
Then came the quarrel of Henry VIII.
with Rome and through the activity of the king&rsquo;s
agents the abbeys were plundered and partially destroyed.
The direct damage inflicted by the looters
was usually limited to tearing the lead from the
roofs, smashing the windows, and defacing the
tombs. Then followed the long ages of neglect and
the decay consequent upon the rains of summer and
the storms of winter. But more than all other
causes that contributed to the ruin and sometimes
complete effacement of the magnificent abbey
buildings, was the vandalism that converted them into
stone walls and hovels&mdash;every one became the
neighborhood quarry and in many instances we owe
the fragments that remain to the solidity that made
tearing down a difficult task.</p>

<p>Furness Abbey is well worth a visit. While
only fragments of its walls remain, excavations have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
been made with such care and intelligence that one
has the whole groundwork of the great establishment
before him and may gain from it an excellent
idea of monastic life. With the sole exception of
Fountains, it is probably the most extensive monastic
ruin in Britain, and while it lacks much of the
beauty and impressiveness of its Yorkshire rival, it
serves to give one a better insight into the daily
life of the ancient occupants. Judged by our
standard, it must have been a rigorous, cheerless life,
though it probably contrasted more favorably with
conditions of its own time. There is today a growing
belief that, on the average, the life of the monks
was not so easy nor so corrupt as apologists for the
ruthless despoilation of the abbeys would have us
think.</p>

<p>I have consumed in these vagaries the space
that I should have devoted to the description of the
abbey; but descriptions are easy to be had and
the best of them will fall short of the interest and
beauty that awaits the visitor to the charming
Lancashire ruin. One may well stay a day at the
hotel, than which there are few in England more
comfortable, more beautifully located, or better in
appointment.</p>

<p>We have covered three thousand miles in our
wanderings and a certain weariness possesses us.
We feel that a rest of a day or two will not come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
amiss, and no place within reach appeals to us as
old York. To our notion the resort towns with
their ostentatious hotels&mdash;Harrogate and Ilkley are
nearer&mdash;cannot compare with the cathedral city
and its Station Hotel as a place where one may be
at ease. The Station, with its unpretentious and
prosaic name, is the property of the railway company,
a great rambling building of yellow brick, unhampered
by limitations of space and so arranged that
every guest-room has light and air from the outside.
There are spacious and finely kept grounds in front
and at some distance to the rear is the station, but
not close enough to disturb the quiet of the hotel.</p>

<p>But York is full two days&rsquo; journey at our rate
of traveling; there is much to see on the way and
our route will be anything but a direct one. We
leave Furness Abbey in the early afternoon and the
skies, which had cleared as we reached Coniston, are
lowering again. The road by which we came
carries us to Ulverston, and from thence we soon
come to Lake Side, at the lower end of Windermere.
The fine road to the north closely skirts the
lake, but the trees stand so thickly that we catch
only occasional glimpses of the water. A light
summer shower is falling, and the fleeting sun and
shadow over the mirrorlike surface, mottled with
patches of gleaming blue and almost inky blackness,
gives us another of the endless phases of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
beauty of Lakeland. For seven or eight miles we
keep close to the shore, through Bowness to Windermere,
two quiet little towns largely given over to
hotels and lodging-houses. The great vogue of
the Lake District as a resort is comparatively recent,
and as a consequence one finds in these towns
a mingling of the ancient and modern. Windermere,
which grew out of the little village of Birthswaite,
is especially accessible, being reached in
about an hour by train from Manchester.</p>

<p>Kendal, the county town of Westmoreland, is
only seven or eight miles from Windermere. Once
a manufacturing center of importance, famous for
its woolens and &ldquo;Kendal Green,&rdquo; it has been gradually
transformed into a quiet, unprogressive market
town. The King&rsquo;s Arms Hotel is one of the most
typical and interesting of the old-time buildings. It
abounds in narrow hallways, odd corners, beamed
ceilings and paneled rooms, all behind a very common
and unpretentious exterior. We have noted
many narrow alleys leading into the main street and
some of these still have heavy gates at the entrance.
We are told that Kendal suffered from frequent
incursions of the Scots during the almost endless
years of border strife, and these alleys afforded quick
refuge for the citizens of the town. The gates were
closed and the marauders thus confined to the main
street, where they became easy targets for the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
behind the barriers. But no such exciting incident
breaks the sleepy quiet of Kendal today, though
the scene before us is not without animation. It is
market day and the streets are thronged with farmers
from the prosperous valley in which the town is
situated. Cattle, sheep and produce seem to be
the chief topics of conversation so far as we can
gather from snatches of the broad North Country
dialect of the men about the town.</p>

<p>Our stay at Kendal is a short one&mdash;we are
soon away for the</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>So Wordsworth describes the narrow green valleys
running between the long ridges of moorland hills
and opening into the wide fertile plain in the center
of which stands the city of York.</p>

<p>We drop southward for some little distance
and then turn to the east, through the very heart
of the hills. Just before we come to Settle, our
attention is attracted by a group of people looking
curiously into a stone trough by the wayside. There
are expressions of disappointment&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not working
today.&rdquo; We are told that this is Settle&rsquo;s ebbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and flowing well, famous over all Yorkshire and
concerning which a learned antiquary has written
a book. But the well is out of commission today&mdash;the
long drouth has affected the spring until for the
second time in the last twenty-five years the phenomenon
has ceased. Ordinarily there is a regular
ebb and flow of the waters at intervals of from five
to fifteen minutes. It is known that this strange
spring has been in existence for hundreds of years,
but the phenomenon has never been satisfactorily
explained.</p>

<p>A little farther we find a striking instance of
how a bad name will linger long after its original
significance has vanished; for Hellifield was once
Hell-in-the-Field, because of its reputation for wickedness.
But surely this straggling little village hardly
looks its formidable cognomen today. A few
miles on the Skipton road brings us in view of a
strangely incongruous spectacle; on one of the rough
hills an oriental temple stands with huge dome and
slender minarets sharply outlined against the evening
sky&mdash;a sight that almost savors of enchantment in
such surroundings. But it is real enough, for an
eccentric Londoner who embraced Buddhism some
years ago, spent a fortune in erecting this temple
on the bare northern hills.</p>

<p>Skipton is near the head of Airedale, but we
see here no sign of the multitudinous factories that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
taint the skies and sully the waters farther down the
Aire, which, if one were to follow it for twenty-five
miles, would take him through the heart of Leeds.
But Skipton is only a market town&mdash;fairly prosperous,
for the narrow vale which surrounds it is famed
as one of the richest pastoral bits of Yorkshire.
The fading light accentuates the gray monotone of
the old houses, and gives a further touch of cheerlessness
to the somewhat bleak aspect of the place.
The large market square is paved with cobblestones
and around it in promiscuous array stand public and
business buildings, among them two hotels, large
but rather unprepossessing structures. A hurried
glance at the interior of each confirms our first impressions
and we bid Skipton a hasty farewell. We
pass under the high walls of the old castle to reach
the Ilkley road. The grim gateway is flanked by
two huge embattled round towers and the walls are
pierced by small mullioned windows. Skipton Castle
was once the stronghold of the Cliffords, and some
say the birthplace of Fair Rosamond, rather than
the almost vanished castle on the Welsh Wye, which
also claims the distinction&mdash;if indeed it be such. It
is wonderfully well preserved&mdash;few other Yorkshire
castles can vie with it in this particular&mdash;and stands
today as sullen and proud as it must have seemed
when the wars of the Roses swept over the land.</p>

<p>A narrow upland road bordered by stone fences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
and leading through bleak hills carries us over the
moorland ridge that lies between Airedale and
Wharfdale, and on entering the latter, the comfortable-looking
Devonshire Arms stands squarely
across our way. We find it a quiet, pleasant place,
seemingly half inn and half home for the family
of the genial landlord. It is situated near the entrance
to the grounds of Bolton Abbey and its
pretty gardens to the rear slope down to the rippling
Wharfe. The inn is the property of the Duke
of Devonshire, to whom the abbey grounds belong,
and as he was averse to Sunday visitors at the abbey,
the hotel is licensed as a &ldquo;six-day house.&rdquo; No one
may be taken in and no meal served to anyone not
already a guest, on Sunday. When we left the
hotel we did not expect to return, and by paying
our bill practically gave up our status as guests of
the Devonshire Arms. But it chanced that we were
back in time for lunch and a serious discussion took
place between our landlord and his assistants as to
whether we might be accommodated or not. It was
finally decided to stretch a point in our favor and to
assume that we had not severed our relations when
we left in the morning.</p>

<p>A desire possesses us to see something of the
most retired portions of the Yorkshire moors and
from Skipton we start due north over the hills. We
pass Rylstone, the tiny village given to fame by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Wordsworth in his ballad, &ldquo;The White Doe of
Rylstone,&rdquo; and re-enter Wharfdale at Grassington.
The unbroken moors stretch northward on either
side of the river&mdash;a country quite devoid of roads
excepting the indifferent ones on each side of the
Wharfe&mdash;to the village of Kettlewell. We follow
the right-hand road, narrow, steep and winding,
and altogether a severe test for a motor. Fortunately
it is quite clear, for in many places vehicles could
scarcely pass each other. Nothing could be harsher
and bleaker than the country, even as we saw it in
the prime of summer time, and the little towns seem
almost a part of the country itself. It would be
hard to imagine that there was ever a time when
Grassington, Coniston or Kettlewell did not nestle,
angular and weather-beaten, at the foot of the eternal
hills, and they are as bare and as devoid of the picturesque
touches of the village of southern England
as the hills they lie beneath. They seem to have
little excuse for existence and it is not clear to a
casual visitor how the lonely moors that encircle
them can afford sustenance to their inhabitants.
Lead-mining once employed many people, though
at present most of the mines are exhausted. Kettlewell
is in the very center of the moor; no railroad
comes within many miles of the town. It lies along
a narrow valley&mdash;a mere cleft in the hills&mdash;that
opens into Wharfdale, which itself becomes very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
narrow here. It is a center for those who would
explore the mysteries of the surrounding moors or
who desire to hunt or fish in almost primal solitude.
That there are many such visitors is attested by the
rather good-looking inns at Kettlewell, and altogether,
the village seems less forlorn than the others
we have just passed. The place is not as quiet as
one would expect from its retired location; coaches
are discharging their loads of trippers and evidently
do a thriving business.</p>

<p>One might find it very interesting to continue
northward to Askrigg, another old and quaint moorland
town, and from this to visit Wensleydale&mdash;which
we do later&mdash;but our present plans do not
contemplate this. The road is a very indifferent
one, though probably not much worse than that over
which we came. Returning from Kettlewell we
take the opposite side of the Wharfe, passing at
first close to the river and then beneath gray and
red cliffs that ominously overhang the road. From
the hill-crests at times we have wide panoramas of
the dale, with the silver ribbon of the Wharfe stealing
through it. The road takes us back to the village
of Grassington; from thence we follow a road
whose steep hills and sharp turns engage the closest
attention of the driver until we reach the Devonshire
Arms, as before related.</p>

<p>A short cut across Rumbles Moor brings us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
to the road to Keighley, the last link in the chain
of manufacturing towns stretching up the Aire from
Leeds and which we must pass to reach Haworth,
a name that suggests to anyone conversant with
English letters the gifted but unfortunate Bronte
family. Haworth has no doubt been influenced in
population and activity by its busy neighbor, Keighley,
but the &ldquo;four tough scrambling miles&rdquo; that
Charles Dickens found on his visit a third of a century
ago still lie between. The whole distance is
a continual climb, terminating at the top of the hill,
to which the old town seems to cling rather precariously.
Indeed, there were few more forbidding ascents
that confronted us than this terribly steep,
rough street&mdash;so steep that the paving stones have
been set on edge to enable the horses to climb it.
It is bordered with old-world buildings, gray and
weather-beaten, and forms a fit avenue to the church
that dominates the town from the hill and whose
massive square tower looks far over the desolate
moorlands beyond it. We visited hundreds of ancient
churches in England and the surroundings of
many were somber and even depressing, but surely
none approached Haworth churchyard in the deep,
all-pervading gloom that hovered over the blackened
and thickly clustered gravestones and dimmed
the very sunlight that struggled through the trees
which encircle the place. The hilltop is given up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to the churchyard and there seems to be scarcely
room for another grave, so thickly stand the mouldering
memorials, which mostly antedate the time of
the Brontes. Out beyond, to the westward, lie the
wild black and purple moors, sweeping away even
higher than the church itself and ending in a long
wave of hills rippling darkly against the horizon.</p>

<p>When &ldquo;Jane Eyre,&rdquo; published in 1847, astonished
the literary world, few indeed would have
guessed that the humble authoress lived in this lonely
village, then by far lonelier and more remote than
it is today; and it is still a wonder how one with
such surroundings and of such limited experience
was able to fathom life so deeply. But one need
not be at a loss to account for the strain of melancholy
that runs through the writings of the gifted
sisters. The isolated, dreary village, the church and
rectory, then almost ruinous, the desolate moor
lands and the family tragedy&mdash;the only son dying
an irreclaimable drunkard&mdash;might furnish a background
of gloom even for Wuthering Heights. The
sisters rest in early graves, Charlotte, the eldest, dying
last, in 1855, at the age of thirty-nine. All, together
with the father and unhappy brother, are
buried in Haworth churchyard save Anne, who lies
in St. Mary&rsquo;s at Scarborough.</p>

<p>Haworth has shared the growth in population
that has filled Airedale with manufacturing towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and is now a place of some eight thousand people.
It delights to honor the memory of its distinguished
daughters, and the local Bronte Club has established
a museum containing many interesting relics, manuscripts,
and rare editions.</p>

<p>Retracing our route to Wharfdale, we follow
the fine road through Ilkley and Otley into the broad
green lowlands which surround Old York. There
is no more beautiful country in England than that
through which we course swiftly along. We catch
continual vistas of the Wharfe, no longer a brawling
moorland stream, but sleeping in broad, silvery
reaches in the midst of the luxuriant meadows. We
leave the river road for Harrogate, pause a few moments
to renew our acquaintance with quaint old
Knaresborough, and from thence we glide over
twenty miles of perfect road into York.</p>

SOME NORTH COUNTRY SHRINES</h2>

<p>We have spacious quarters at the Station
Hotel, our lattice windows opening upon a stone
balcony beyond which we can see the fountain,
flowers and shrubbery of the gardens, and farther
away, against the purple sky, the massive yet graceful
towers of the minster. How different the Station
Hotel is from the average railway hotel in
America can be appreciated only by one who has
enjoyed the hospitality of the one and endured the
necessity of staying at the other. We feel as nearly
at home as one possibly may at a hotel, and the
spirit of Shakespeare&rsquo;s worthy who proposes to take
his ease at his inn comes upon us. We look forward
with satisfaction to a short pause in the pleasant
old northern capital, whose splendid church
and importance in ecclesiastical antiquity are rivalled
only by Canterbury.</p>

<p>The two chief cathedral cities of England have
many points of similarity, though in population and
importance York easily leads. And yet, neither
has ever been thoroughly modernized; the
spirit and relics of ancient days confront one every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>where
and the great churches, while dissimilar,
contest for supremacy among English cathedrals.
While Canterbury has the greater historic interest
and the tombs of many famous warriors and churchmen,
York Minster can boast of perhaps the finest
windows in the world. But why should I compare
or contrast these delightful towns? When one is
in Canterbury there is no place like Canterbury, and
when in York, why York is without a rival. And
after all, neither has much claim to place in this chronicle,
which is not to tell of the familiar shrines.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the vicinity of York
abounds in magnificent country seats and historic
mansions, many of which are open to the public
on specified days. Of these, few are statelier than
Castle Howard, the seat of the Earls of Carlisle,
about fifteen miles to the northwest. It can boast of
little historic interest, for it was built less than two
hundred years ago, after the turmoil of internal warfare
had ceased in England. It is therefore not a
castle in the accepted sense, but a stately private
residence designed by Vanbrugh, the architect of
Blenheim. Though its architectural faults have been
enlarged upon by critics, none can gainsay the impressiveness
of the building, and Ferguson, in his
&ldquo;History of Modern Architecture,&rdquo; declares that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>&ldquo;would be difficult to point out a more imposing
country home possessed by any nobleman in England
than this palace of the Howards.&rdquo; With its central
dome and purely classic facade, pierced by monotonous
rows of tall windows, it presents the aspect
of a public building&mdash;reminding us of some of the
state capitols in America&mdash;rather than a private
home. Though it serves as the home of the owner a
considerable part of the time, it is really a great
museum, rich in paintings and other works of art
which have been accumulated by the family, which
has always been a wealthy one.</p>

<div class="center">
<a name="bw_25" id="bw_25"></a><img src="images/bw_25.jpg" width="600" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CASTLE HOWARD.</p>
</div>

<p>The surroundings of the palace are in keeping
with its vast size and architectural importance. It
is situated in a large park and stands on slightly
rising grounds overlooking a panorama of lawnlike
meadows, diversified with fine trees and shimmering
lakes. Near at hand are the somewhat formal
gardens, ornamented with monuments and statuary.
As a show place it is in much favor with the people
of England and few of the great houses are more
accessible to everyone. Though we did not arrive
at the regular hour for visitors, we had little difficulty
in gaining admission and were shown about
as though we had been welcome guests rather than
the nuisances which I fear ordinary tourists are often
regarded in such places. The formality of securing
tickets is not required and no admission fee is
charged.</p>

<p>While the interior of the palace is disappoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>ing&mdash;huge,
cold, unhomelike rooms&mdash;its contents are
of greatest interest. Among the pictures there are
examples of English and foreign masters&mdash;Gainsborough,
Lely, Van Dyke, Reynolds, and many
more&mdash;and there are treasures among the rare books,
bronzes and sculptures which have been collected
through many generations. The present earl is himself
a man of literary and artistic tastes, and numerous
paintings, done by himself, hang in the galleries.</p>

<p>From the large low windows an enchanting
view presented itself. Stretches of beautiful park,
dotted with ancient trees, through which gleamed
the placid waters of the lake&mdash;now like dull silver,
for the sky had become overcast&mdash;sloped away from
the front, while to the rear lay the gardens with all
the bloom of English summer time. Out just beyond
these is a many-pillared circular structure, like a classic
temple, the burial-place of the Howards for many
generations. Verily the surroundings almost savor
of enchantment, and form, with the great mansion
itself, a background of splendor and romance for
the ancient family. And the very freedom with
which such places are thrown open to people of all
degrees does much to entrench the feudal system in
England.</p>

<p>But we have lingered long enough at Castle
Howard; the sky is lowering and gray sheets of
rain are sweeping through the trees. We hasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
to the trusty car and are soon ensconced beneath its
rainproof coverings. It is gloomy and cheerless
enough, but it would have seemed far more so could
we have foreseen that for the next ten days the
weather would be little better. One loses much
under such conditions. The roads as a rule are not
affected and with a reliable motor one may keep
going quite as well as on sunshiny days; but the
beauty of the landscapes will often be shut out, and
a succession of dull, chilly days has a decidedly
depressing effect on one&rsquo;s spirits.</p>

<p>The direct route across the moor to Thirsk
is impassable&mdash;the heavy rain has made it a trail of
deep mud, and we dare not attempt its precipitous
&ldquo;bank&rdquo; under such conditions. A detour of many
miles by way of Easingwold is necessary, but once
on the North Road there is ample opportunity to
make up for delay. Country constables will hardly
be abroad in the driving rain and the motor purrs
quite as contentedly and drives the car quite as
swiftly as in the sunniest weather.</p>

<p>We splash through the streets of Thirsk with
a glance at its church tower, the one redeeming
feature of the town. The rain soon ceases, but a
gray mist half hides the outlines of the Cleveland
Hills on our right and hangs heavily over the fertile
valley to our left. It is of little consequence, for
there are few stretches of main road in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
that have less to detain the wayfarer than the forty-eight
miles from York to Stockton-on-Tees. Yarm
is a sleepy town overshadowed by its majestic church
tower, which again impresses us how the church
alone often relieves the squalidness and gives a touch
of sentiment to many an uninteresting English village.
At Yarm we enter the broad vale of the Tees and
again traverse the wide, unattractive street of Stockton.
Twenty miles farther Durham&rsquo;s stately towers
loom in dim outline against the gray sky; we
cautiously wend our way through the crooked streets
of the cathedral town and plunge into the fog that
hangs heavily over the Newcastle road.</p>

<p>We come into Newcastle about lamplighting
time, weary and somewhat bedraggled from our long
flight over the rain-soaked roads. And Newcastle-on-Tyne,
at the close of a rainy day, is about the
last place to cheer one&rsquo;s drooping spirits. The lamps
glimmer dimly through the fog as we splash along
the bumpy streets to the Station Hotel&mdash;and few
hostelries were more genuinely welcome during all
our long wanderings. Nor is Newcastle less dingy
and unattractive on the following morning&mdash;the
rain is still falling and black clouds of sooty smoke
hang over the place. London is bad enough under
such conditions, but the Tyne city is worse and our
first anxiety is to get on the open road again, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
it chanced we were doomed to disappointment for
much of the day.</p>

<p>Amidst all the evidences of modern industry&mdash;the
coal-mining and ship-building that have made
Newcastle famous&mdash;there still linger many relics of
the ancient order, memorials of the day when all was
rural and quiet along the Tyne. In the very midst
of the factories and shipyards at Jarrow, a suburb
a few miles down the river, still stands the abbey
church where some thirteen hundred years ago the
Venerable Bede wrote those chronicles which form
the basis of ancient English history. Thither we
resolved to go and found the way with no small
difficulty to the bald, half-ruined structure on the
bank of a small stream whose waters reeked with
chemicals from a neighboring factory. Though much
restored, the walls and tower of the church are the
same that sheltered the monastic brotherhood in the
time of Bede, about the seventh century. The
present monastic ruins, however, are of Norman origin,
the older Saxon foundation having quite disappeared.
Several relics of Bede are preserved in
the church, among them the rude, uncomfortable
chair he is said to have used. Altogether, this shrine
of the Father of English History is full of interest
and when musing within its precincts one will
not fail to recall the story of Bede&rsquo;s death. For tradition
has it that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>&ldquo;He was translating St. John&rsquo;s
Gospel into English when he was attacked by a
sudden illness and felt he was dying. He kept on
with his task, however, and continued dictating to
his scribe, bidding him write quickly. When he
was told that the book was finished, he said, &lsquo;You
speak truth, all is finished now,&rsquo; and after singing
&lsquo;Glory to God,&rsquo; he quietly passed away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Tyne valley road to Carlisle on the south
side of the river by the way of Hexham looks very
well on the map, but the run would be a wearisome
one under favorable conditions; in the face of a continual
rain it is even more of a task, and no one
motoring for pleasure should take this route. It is
rough and hilly and runs through a succession of
mining and manufacturing towns. The road follows
the edge of the moorland hills to the southward, and
in many places the hillsides afford wide views over
the Tyne valley, but the gray rain obscured the
prospect for us and only an occasional lull gave
some hint of the broad vale and the purple Northumbrian
Hills beyond.</p>

<p>Hexham is beautifully situated a mile or two
below the juncture of the northern and southern
branches of the Tyne, lying in a nook of the wooded
hills, while the broad river sweeps past beneath.
The low square tower of its abbey church looms up
over the town from the commanding hill. It is one
of the most important in the North Country, rivaling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the cathedrals in proportions, and has only recently
been restored.</p>

<p>Here we crossed to the northern side of the
river to reach the most stupendous relic of the Roman
occupation of Britain&mdash;the wall which Hadrian built
as a protection against the incursions of the wild
northern tribes. This wall was seventy miles in
length&mdash;from Tynemouth to the Solway&mdash;of an average
thickness of eight feet and probably not less than
eighteen feet in height. It surmounted the chain of
hills overlooking the valley between Newcastle and
Carlisle and was well supplied with military defenses
in the shape of forts and battlemented towers.
We closely followed the line of the wall from Chollerford
to Greenhead, a distance of about fifteen
miles. In places it is still wonderfully perfect, being
built of hewn stone, well fitted and carefully laid,
as it must have been to stand the storms of eighteen
hundred years; but most of the distance the course
of the wall is now marked only by an earthen ridge.</p>

<p>We had seen many relics of the Roman rule
in England at Bath, at York, and also the remarkable
remains of Uriconium near Shrewsbury, but
nothing so impressed us with the completeness of the
Roman occupation as this great wall of Hadrian.
And it also testifies mutely to the great difficulty the
Roman legions must have experienced in controlling
the light-armed bandits from across the border, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
a day when the means of communication were so
few and so slow. This situation continued until several
hundred years later, the country along the Tyne,
the narrow neck of land connecting England and
Scotland, being the scene of constant turmoil and
bloody strife. The wild tribes of the northern hills
would sweep down into the valley, leaving a strip of
burned and plundered country, and before soldiers
could be gotten into the field the marauders would
retreat to their native fastnesses. One might not
telephone to Carlisle that the Campbells or McGregors
were raiding the country, and troops could not
be hurried by railroad to the scene of trouble. Before
the horseback messenger could reach the authorities,
the marauders would have disappeared. This condition
of things the Romans sought to overcome by
building the great wall and one can hardly doubt
that they chose the best means at their command;
but the history of those times is hazy at best and
we can learn little of what was really accomplished
by this stupendous undertaking.</p>

<p class="caption">REMAINS OF GREAT ROMAN WALL NEAR HEXHAM.</p>
</div>

<p>The road through the rough Northumbrian hills
is as lonely and desolate as any one will find in England.
So much has it fallen into disuse that the
grass and heather have almost obliterated it in places,
and it appeared that little had been done to maintain
it for years. The cheerless day accentuated
the dreariness of the rough countryside; the rain had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
increased to a downpour and had blown in upon us
in spite of our coverings. The road was clear, fairly
level and straight away; despite its rough surface we
splashed onward at a swift pace through the pools
and rivulets that submerged it in places.</p>

<p>Naworth Castle, also an estate of the Earl of
Carlisle, the owner of Castle Howard, is just off
the road before entering Brampton, eight or nine
miles out of Carlisle. It is thrown open with the
same freedom that prevails at the great Yorkshire
house, but though the greater part of Naworth is
far older, it has less to interest the casual visitor.
Situated as it is in the very center of the scenes of
border turmoil, it has a stirring history dating back
to 1300, when it was built by Lord Dacre, ancestor
of the Howards. The story of his elopement with
the heiress who owned the estate and who was betrothed
to a boy of seven, and of the subsequent pardon
of the lovers by the King Edward, forms a
romantic background for the stern-looking old place;
but we will not recount the many legends that
gathered about the castle during the long period of
border warfare. Escaping almost unscathed during
the castle-smashing time of Cromwell, Naworth suffered
severely from fire in 1844, but the interior has
since been remodeled into a fairly comfortable modern
dwelling. Here again the artistic and literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
tastes of the owner are evident in the valuable library
and the fine gallery of paintings.</p>

<p class="caption">NAWORTH CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Continuing our way through Naworth Park,
we drop down the narrow and fearfully steep lane
to the vale of the Irthing and cross over the old
high-arched bridge to Lanercost Priory. The rain
is still falling and no doubt the custodian has given
up hope of visitors on such a day, for he cannot be
found; but we discover the gardener, who secures
the keys from the neighboring rectory and proves
himself a capable guide. The abbey church has
been restored by the Carlisles and is used by the
parish as a place of worship. All about are the red
sandstone ruins of a once great monastery. We
wander among the mossy grave-stones and crumbling
tombs,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The &lsquo;Miserere&rsquo; in the moss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The &lsquo;Mercy Jesu&rsquo; in the rain,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>calling up thoughts of a forgotten order of things.
In the roofless chapel we pause before an altar-tomb,
its sandstone bosses water-soaked and crumbling in
the rain&mdash;it is the oldest in the abbey and covers the
grave of Lord Roland de Vaux of Triermaine,
an ancestor of the Dacres. The name seems familiar
and the lines,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Murmuring over the name again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord Roland de Vaux of Triermaine,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<p>come unbidden to my mind. Ah, yes! it is in the
weird music of &ldquo;Christabel&rdquo; that the name of the
long-dead baron is interwoven, and perhaps his
&ldquo;castle good&rdquo; was the predecessor of Naworth.
There are other elaborate tombs of the Dacres and
Howards, and there is a world of pathos in Sir Edward
Boehm&rsquo;s terra cotta effigy of little Elizabeth,
daughter of the present earl, who died in 1883. It
is the figure of an infant child asleep, with one little
rounded arm thrown above the head and the other
folded gracefully on the breast, while a quiet smile
plays over the dimpled face&mdash;</p>

<p>But come&mdash;it is late, and Lanercost Priory
would be gloomy enough on such a day without the
infant figure. We retrace our way through the ivy-mantled
portal and hasten through the park to the
Carlisle road, which shortly brings us to the border
city, and grateful indeed is the old-fashioned hospitality
of the County Hotel, one of the most pleasant
among the famous inns of the North Country.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII">XIII</a><br />
ACROSS THE TWEED</h2>

<p>Gretna Green is a disappointingly modern-looking
hamlet, and has little to accord with the romantic
associations that its name always brings up.
In olden days it gained fame as a place where marriages
were accomplished with an ease and celerity
that is rivalled in our time only by the dissolution
of the tie in some of our own courts. Hither the
eloping couples hastened from England, to be united
with scarcely other ceremony than mutual promises&mdash;witnesses
were not required&mdash;and a worthy blacksmith
did a thriving business merely by acting as
clerk to record the marriages. The ceremony was
legally valid in Scotland and therefore had to be
recognized in England, according to mutual agreement
of the nations to recognize each other&rsquo;s institutions.
But today Gretna Green&rsquo;s ancient source
of fame and revenue has vanished; no Young Lochinvars
flee wildly across the Solway to its refuge;
it is just a prosaic Scotch village, whose greatest excitement
is occasioned by the motor cars that sweep
through on the fine Edinburgh road.</p>

<p>Quite different is the fame of Ecclefechan, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
few miles farther&mdash;a mean-looking village closely
skirting the road for a half-mile. Typically Scotch
in its bleakness and angularity, it seems fittingly indeed
the birthplace of the strange genius who was,
in some respects, the most remarkable man of letters
of the last century. Thomas Carlyle was born here
in 1795 and sleeps his last sleep, alone, in the village
kirkyard, for Jane Welsh is not buried by his
side. As we came into the town, we paused directly
opposite the whitewashed cottage where the
sage was born and which is still kept sacred to his
memory. The old woman caretaker welcomed us
in broadest Scotch and showed us about with unalloyed
pride and satisfaction. Here are gathered
mementoes and relics of Carlyle&mdash;books, manuscripts
and pictures; the memorial presented him in 1875,
bearing the signature of almost every noted literary
contemporary; the wreath sent by Emperor William
in 1895 to be laid on the grave; and other things of
more or less curious significance. The cottage itself
is a typical home of the Scotch villager, the
tiny rooms supplied with huge fireplaces and the
quaint old-time kitchen still in daily use by the caretaker.
The house was built by Carlyle&rsquo;s father, a
stonemason by trade, to whose &ldquo;solid honest work&rdquo;
the distinguished son was wont proudly to refer on
divers occasions. The motor car is awakening
Ecclefechan to the fact that it is the birthplace of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
man famous the world over, for they told us that
many visitors now came like ourselves.</p>

<p>There are no finer stretches of road in Scotland
than the broad, beautifully engineered highway
from Carlisle to Lanark, winding among the
hills with grades so gentle as to be almost imperceptible.
The rain, which followed us since we left
Carlisle, has ceased and many panoramas of hill
and valley lie before us. Oftentimes the low-hung
clouds partially obscure the view, but aside from
this the scene stretches away clear and sharp to the
gray belt of the horizon. We are passing through
the hills of Tintock Moor, which Burns has sung as</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Yon wild mossy mountains so lofty and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nurse in their bosom the youth of the Clyde.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>They may have seemed &ldquo;lofty and wide&rdquo; to the
poet who never left his native soil, but they are
only low green hills. The river here is little more
than a brawling brook, leaping through the stony
vale.</p>

<p>Before we came into Edinburgh we paused at
Rosslyn Chapel, perhaps, after Melrose, Abottsford
and Ayr, the most frequented shrine in all Scotland.
Conveyances of all kinds ply continuously from Edinburgh
during the season, and though the day was not
especially favorable, we found a throng at the chap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>el.
The chapel is admittedly the most elaborate
Gothic building in Britain. The intricacy and
minuteness of detail are simply marvelous and compel
the admiration of even those who condemn the
ornamentation as overdone and wearisome when
studied closely; still, Sir Gilbert Scott designated
Rosslyn as &ldquo;a poem in stone,&rdquo; and Wordsworth
was so impressed that he wrote one of his finest sonnets
in praise of it.</p>

<p>One must of course hear the oft-told story of
the master workman who, puzzled over the intricate
drawings of one of the carved pillars, went to
Rome to consult the architect of the Vatican; but
while he was away his apprentice solved the problem
and when the builder returned the finished column
greeted his eyes. He was so enraged at the
success of the apprentice in overcoming the difficulty
that he struck the poor youth dead at the foot
of the pillar and was hanged for the crime. Anyway,
the pillar is there and it is not at all unlikely
that the master workman was hanged&mdash;a very common
incident in those days.</p>

<p>Nor will the guide forget to remind you that
in the vault beneath your feet the barons of Rosslyn
for the past six hundred years have been buried,
each one sheathed in full armor. And there is a
tradition that on the night before the death of a lord
of Rosslyn the chapel seems to be enveloped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
flames, a superstition upon which Scott founded his
ballad of &ldquo;Rosabelle.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Seemed all on fire that chapel proud<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where Rosslyn&rsquo;s chiefs uncoffined lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each baron for a sable shroud<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sheathed in his iron panoply.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The castle near at hand is as severely plain
and rude as the chapel is ornate&mdash;a bare, gloomy
place that tells in itself volumes of the hard, comfortless
life of the &ldquo;good old days.&rdquo; The apartments
of the lord of the castle would be counted a sorry
prison-house now&mdash;one that would bring forth a
protest from the Howard Society&mdash;and what shall
one say of the quarters for the serving-men and soldiers,
or of the dungeon itself, where the unfortunate
captives were confined? Nothing, for our
powers of expression are inadequate; language itself
is inadequate. Thank God, the order of things
is changed!</p>

<p>Edinburgh, with its wealth of historic and literary
associations, its famous castle and storied palaces,
its classic architecture and its fine shops, will
always appeal to the wayfarer, I care not how often
he may come; but it is too widely known to
engage this chronicle of more unfamiliar Britain.</p>

<p>The excellent North British Hotel, where,
wonder of wonders in Britain, you may, if fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
enough, secure a heated bathroom en suite, might
well tempt us to a longer stay; but we must be on,
and the next afternoon finds us on the road to
Queensferry. Here our motor, with two or three
others, is loaded on a ferryboat which carries us
across the Firth of Forth. We pass directly under
the bridge, and in no other way can one get a really
adequate idea of this marvelous structure, which,
despite all the recent achievements of bridge-building,
still holds its place as the most remarkable feat
of engineering in its class.</p>

<p>About Loch Leven and the ruin that rears its
low, square tower from the clustered foliage of its
tiny islet, there will always hover an atmosphere of
romance. And why should it not be thus, since
the authentic feats that history records have in them
more of romance than many of the wild tales of
the imagination? But more than this: the halo which
the genius of Scott has thrown over the spot and
the song and story that have been builded on the
captivity and escape of the fair prisoner of Loch
Leven, continue to make the placid lake a shrine
for many pilgrims.</p>

<p>We entered Kinross, the quiet village on the
western shore of the lake, and followed the road
to the boathouse, where an English motor party
had just paused. Word had to be sent to the village
for boatmen and I fell into conversation with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the Englishman who was waiting like ourselves.
He had come to Loch Leven on quite a different
mission from ours&mdash;old castles and legends were so
commonplace to him that he hardly seemed to understand
why anyone should trouble himself about
them. He had come to fish and assured us that
Loch Leven trout were surpassed in excellence only
by those in an Irish lake where he had fished the
week before. He was sending his car away and expected
to pass the night in pursuing the gentle art of
Ike Walton. We were told that more people came
to the lake to fish than to visit the castle. The fishing
rights are owned by a local club and are jealously
guarded. The minimum license fee for trout,
of seven shillings sixpence, with an additional charge
per hour, makes the sport a somewhat expensive
luxury.</p>

<p>But our boatmen had come and we put off for
the castle. The lake averages very shallow, and it
was necessary to go considerably out of the direct
route, even in the light row-boat, to avoid the shoals.
The bottom in many places was covered with a
rank sedge, which our boatman declared fatal to fishing.
It had gotten in the lake a few years ago&mdash;had
come from America in some mysterious manner&mdash;and
nothing could be done to check its rapid
spread. While he bewailed the ravages of this interloper&mdash;from
the land of the interlopers&mdash;our boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
grated on the pebbly shore of the island. The
castle, rude and ruinous indeed, is quite small and
the only part intact is the low, square tower of the
keep. In this is Queen Mary&rsquo;s chamber, and one
may look down from the window from which she
made her escape; the water then came up to the
wall, though it is now several yards away. One
need not rehearse the story of the queen&rsquo;s imprisonment
at Loch Leven by the ambitious Douglas and
her romantic escape through connivance with her
captor&rsquo;s son, George Douglas, who succumbed to
her charms as did nearly every one who came into
her company. And who can wonder that the actual
presence of the fair queen&mdash;whose name still
enchants us after three hundred years&mdash;should prove
so irresistible to those who met her face to face?
Is it strange that one whose memory can cast such
a glamour over the cheerless old pile that has brought
us hither, should have so strongly influenced her associates?</p>

<p>But after all, the view from the castle tower
would be worth the journey thither. All about the
placid water lies gleaming like a mirror beneath the
threatening sky; here we see a flock of water-fowl,
so tame that they scarcely heed the fishing-boats;
there a pair of stately swans, many of which are on
the lake; off yonder is the old town with its spire
sharp against the horizon; and near at hand, the en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>circling
hills and the low green meadows, a delightful
setting for the flashing gem of the lake&mdash;all combine
to make a scene that would be inspiring even
if the name of Mary Stuart had never been associated
with Loch Leven. As we drift away from
the island, the words of a minor poet come to us,
strangely sweet and appropriate:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;No warden&rsquo;s fire shall e&rsquo;er again<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Illume Loch Leven&rsquo;s bosom fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No clarion shrill of armed men<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The breeze across the lake shall bear;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But while remains a stone of thine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It shall be linked to royal fame&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here the Rose of Stuart&rsquo;s line<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hath left the fragrance of her name!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Loch Leven anglers have made two or
three well-appointed hotels possible in Kinross, and
Green&rsquo;s, where we stopped for tea, seemed ideal for
its quiet retirement and old-fashioned comfort.</p>

<p>St. Andrews, by the sea, has a combination
of attractions, of which the famous golf links will
occur to many people on first thought. There is
no town in Scotland more popular as a seaside resort
and the numerous hotels are crowded in season.
But the real merits of St. Andrews are the ones
least known to the world at large&mdash;its antiquity, the
ruins of its once stately cathedral, its grim though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
much shattered castle, and its university, the oldest
in Scotland&mdash;one and all, if better known, would
bring many tourists who do not care for golf links
and resort hotels.</p>

<p>Hither we came from Kinross by the way of
Cupar, of which we know nothing save the old
Scotch saw of a headstrong man, &ldquo;He that will to
Cupar maun to Cupar,&rdquo; but why anyone should be
so determined to go to Cupar is not clear. It is a
mean-looking town with cobblestone pavement so
rough that it tried every rivet in our car, and nothing
could be drearier than the rows of gray slate-roofed
houses standing dejectedly in the rain.</p>

<p>We were early risers, according to their reckoning
at the Marine Hotel, and went for a walk
over the golf links after breakfast. I was once a devotee
of the royal game and was able to appreciate
why the links by the sea are counted the finest in
the world. Stretching along a sandy beach over
which the tide advances and recedes incessantly, the
links have unlimited sweep over the lawnlike lowlands,
with just enough obstacles, mostly natural, to
make a game of highest skill possible. The lowering
sky of the preceding day had cleared and the keen
wind swept in over the northern sea. We would
have been glad to linger, if possible, but there was
much to see in the old town which, in the words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Thomas Carlyle, &ldquo;has the essence of all the antiquity
in Scotland in good clean condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Directly on the ocean stands the scanty but
still imposing ruin of the cathedral, which in its
prime was one of the most magnificent churches in
the Kingdom. Its burnished roof once shone far out
at sea and a wilderness of turrets and pinnacles rose
round the central tower, long since vanished. The
church was for some centuries the center of ecclesiastical
life in Scotland. Its dedication took place in
1318, &ldquo;as a trophy and memorial of Bannockburn,&rdquo;
in the august presence of King Robert the Bruce.
And yet it was only two hundred and forty years
later that fanaticism sounded the doom of the splendid
church; when the Presbyterian Council gave
orders that the &ldquo;monuments of idolatry&rdquo; be pulled
down. John Knox writes in his journal that the
work went forward &ldquo;with expedition,&rdquo; and for many
years the marvelous Gothic pile served the people of
St. Andrews as a quarry.</p>

<p>The original outlines of the cathedral are clearly
indicated on the smoothly mown greensward and
give an adequate idea of its vast extent. The square
tower of St. Regulus&rsquo; Chapel is the only portion intact,
and this we ascend by the dark, time-worn
stairs inside. From the top there is a fine view of
the town, a broad sweep of glittering sea and a far-reaching
prospect to the landward. The town lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
immediately beneath, spread out like a map, and
from every direction the white country roads wander
in to join the maze of crooked streets. Only a hundred
yards away, on the very verge of the sea, is
the castle, and we go thither when we descend.
And we are rather glad to descend, for the wind
blows so strongly that the tower trembles despite all
its solidity&mdash;and one cannot help thinking of the
Campanile at Venice.</p>

<p>It seems rather incongruous that the massive,
martial-looking castle should originally have been
the palace of the Bishop of St. Andrews, but it
was in an age when the church and the military went
hand in hand. It was not strange, perhaps, in Scotland,
where the greater part of the murderous wars
among the people sprang out of religious disputes,
that the home of a church dignitary should be a
stronghold, and the traditions of St. Andrews Castle
tell more of violence and bloodshed than the annals
of many a secular fortress.</p>

<p>It is a strange comment on the ferocity of the
old-time churchmen that one of the most fiendish
relics of &ldquo;man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man&rdquo; is to be found
in this martial bishop&rsquo;s palace. Like all gruesome
things, it is the center of interest, and the rheumatic
old custodian had learned the attraction of the horrible
for average human nature, for he greeted us
with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; to see the bottle dungeon
first.&rdquo; He led us into the dark shadows of the &ldquo;sea
tower,&rdquo; as John Knox designated it, and placing a
lighted candle on a staff, dropped it into a circular
opening four or five feet in diameter. Looking
down, we could see a bottle-shaped cavity hewn out
of the solid rock, and extending below the level of
the sea. Into this the captives were lowered, and
with no light and little air were left to a dreadful
death, their moans drowned by the thunder of the
waves overhead. Or perhaps a more merciful fate
might be meted to some of them&mdash;even though it
were death at the stake&mdash;for we know that George
Wishart, whom Cardinal Beaton burned before the
castle, had first been imprisoned in the dungeon.
One almost breathes a sigh of relief to know that
shortly afterwards the Presbyterians stormed the fortress
and slew the inhuman cardinal, whose body
was thrown into the dungeon after having been exposed
from the castle walls. John Knox was one
of the party that slew Beaton, and he wrote a gloating
account of the incident.</p>

<p>But enough of these horrors, which the old
custodian drones over in broad Scotch dialect. Let
us go out upon the pleasant greensward of the courtyard,
where there is little to remind us of the terrible
deeds that have transpired within the gloomy
walls. The seaward walls have nearly disappeared,
for the stone was used in work on the harbor by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
generation that little dreamed of the value posterity
would set on such historic monuments.</p>

<p>Following the coast road from St. Andrews to
Kirkcaldy, we were seldom out of sight of the sea,
and passed through several little fishertowns centuries
old and quite looking their years. Largo is
the birthplace of Alexander Selkirk, whose experiences
on a desert island gave DeFoe the idea of
&ldquo;Robinson Crusoe.&rdquo; The house where he was born
still stands and a stone figure of Crusoe is set just
in front in a niche in the wall. In all of these coast
towns an old-world quiet seemed to reign save in
the &ldquo;long town&rdquo; of Kirkcaldy, through whose dirty
streets, thronged with filthy children, we carefully
picked our way. Here we turned inland, passing
a succession of towns whose rubbish-covered streets
were full of drunken miners&mdash;it was Saturday afternoon&mdash;who
stumbled unconcernedly in front of
the car; and not a few drunken women joined in
the yells which often greeted us. The road was
very bumpy and it is a far from pleasant or interesting
route until the neighborhood of Dunfermline is
reached.</p>

<p>Dunfermline should be a household word in
America, for here is the modest slate-roofed cottage
where our great dispenser of free libraries was
born and which he purchased some years ago. He
is a sort of fairy godfather to Dunfermline and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
showered on the town more wealth than the canny
burghers know what to do with. We had a letter
of introduction to one of the linen manufacturers&mdash;linen-making
is the great industry of Dunfermline&mdash;and
he insisted upon showing us about the town.
He pointed out some of the benefactions of Mr.
Carnegie, who, besides the regulation free library,
gave a large sum toward the restoration of the abbey
church and to establish a public park. Still more,
he has set aside a sum of no less than half a million
sterling, the income from which is to be spent under
the direction of a board of trustees in promoting
&ldquo;the higher welfare, physical, intellectual and moral,
of the inhabitants.&rdquo; So great are his benefactions
that Dunfermline has been afforded the opportunity
of becoming a model town in every respect, though
the experiment is still in its infancy.</p>

<p>The abbey church is one of the most interesting
in Scotland and is the shrine of all patriotic Scots,
for here is buried King Robert the Bruce, whose
name is cut in huge letters in the balustrade surrounding
the tower. The nave of the church has
been restored and is now used as a place of worship,
and there remains enough of the ruined monastery
to give the needed touch of the picturesque.</p>

<p>On leaving the town we were somewhat at a
loss for the road, and asked a respectable-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
gray-whiskered gentleman if he could direct us to
Alloa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are twa roads to Alloa&mdash;do
you wish the upper or the lower road?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We expressed our indifference; we only wanted
the best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no saying which is the best,&rdquo; he said
cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But which would you take yourself?&rdquo; we insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you must be sae particular, I&rsquo;d say that
I should tak the lower road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be the lower road, then,&rdquo;&mdash;but he held
up his hand at the first click of the starting lever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you have decided to tak the lower road,
I might say that I live a few miles out on this, and
seeing there&rsquo;s an empty seat, perhaps ye&rsquo;ll be willing
to give me a ride.&rdquo; It was now clear why he
had been so non-communicative. He did not wish
to unduly influence us for his own advantage; but
after it was all decided on our own motion, he felt
free to avail himself of the opportunity to be relieved
of a tiresome walk. A few miles out he
pointed to a neat residence&mdash;his home&mdash;and our
canny Scotsman left us.</p>

<p>The next day we were in Edinburgh, after
passing the night at Stirling. It had rained fitfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
during our tour in Fife and a gray mantle still hung
over &ldquo;Auld Reekie,&rdquo;&mdash;though perhaps the name is
less appropriate than when Scott first used it. The
Fifeshire roads averaged bad&mdash;rough and stony and
often quite slippery from the rain. We were glad
to pass the day in our comfortable rooms at the
North British watching the rain-soaked city from
our windows. But it was no better on the following
day and we were soon on the North Berwick
road in the same discouraging drizzle. Nothing
could be more depressing under such conditions than
the succession of wretched suburban towns through
which we passed for some distance out of Edinburgh.
The streets, despite the rain, were full of
dirty children and bedraggled women, and we were
glad to come into the open road along the sea. It
is a road that must afford magnificent views in fine
weather, but for us it wended along a wind-swept,
chocolate-colored ocean that was quickly lost in the
driving rain. There are numerous seaside resorts between
Portobello and North Berwick, though the
latter is the more popular and is supplied with palatial
hotels.</p>

<p>It was just beyond here that we caught sight
of the object of our pilgrimage along the Firth&mdash;the
old Douglas castle of Tantallon, which, mirrored
in Scott&rsquo;s heroic lines, excited and dazzled our
youthful imagination. It stands drearily on a bleak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
headland and was half hidden in the gray gusts of
rain when</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Close before us showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His towers, Tantallon vast.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But its vastness has diminished since the day of
which Scott wrote, for much of the castle has disappeared
and the sea wall which ran along the edge
of the rock has crumbled away. Still, the first impression
one gets of the shapeless ruin as he crosses
the waterless moat and rings the bell for admission
is one of majesty, despite the decay riot everywhere.
We waited long, almost despairing of gaining entrance,
when the keeper appeared at the gate. He
was not expecting visitors on such a stormy day
and had been drowsing over old papers in his little
booth inside.</p>

<div class="center">
<a name="bw_28" id="bw_28"></a><img src="images/bw_28.jpg" width="600" height="421" alt="" />
<p class="caption">TANTALLON CASTLE AND BASS ROCK.</p>
</div>

<p>There is not much to remind one of the fiery
parting between Douglas and Marmion so vividly
described by Scott. But a mere shell of the castle
remains; the draw-bridge of the ringing lines is gone,
and the inner walls from which the retainers might
have watched the fierce encounter have long since
crumbled away. The courtyard where the doughty
warriors engaged in their altercation is covered with
grasses and starred with wild flowers. About all
that remains as it was in the day of Douglas is the
dungeon hewn from the solid rock beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
walls. We wandered about the roofless, dripping
ruins as the old keeper told us the story of the castle
and pointed out the spots that have been identified
with the song of Scott. Here stood the battlements
from which the disconsolate Clare contemplated
the desolate ocean&mdash;here was the chapel
where Wilton was armed by old Archibald&mdash;</p>

<p>But the rain has ceased and blue rifts are coming
in the sky. As we look oceanward, a mountainlike
bulk rises dimly out of the dull waters. &ldquo;Bass
Rock,&rdquo; says our guide, &ldquo;and a peety it is that the
sea is too rough for the boots today.&rdquo; A weird island
it is, less than a mile in circumference, rising to
the stupendous height of four hundred feet, though
it little looks it from Tantallon&mdash;our guess was less
than a quarter as great. In old days the rock was
quite inaccessible; it was early fortified and in later
times was made a prison. Here was confined a
group of the persecuted Covenanters, who lay in
the damp, dark dungeons, &ldquo;envying the freedom of
the birds&rdquo;&mdash;the gulls and wild geese that wheel
almost in clouds about the rock. Dreadful times
these&mdash;but to appreciate the real horror of such a
fate one would have to stand on Bass Rock when
the storm walks abroad and the wild German Ocean
wraps the rock in the white mist of the angry waves.
The rock serves little purpose now save as a site for
a lighthouse, built a few years ago, and as a resort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
for curious tourists, who can visit it when the weather
allows landing to be made.</p>

<p>Turning southward through the Lammermuir
Hills, we find at the little village of East Linton a
surprise in the Black Lion, another of those homelike
and wonderfully comfortable Scotch inns which
offer genuine cheer to the wayfarer. Here a fire
dances in the grate and our luncheon is one that
the more pretentious hotels do not equal. We resume
our flight under leaden skies through the low
gray mists that sweep the hilltops. Haddington is
famed for its abbey church, very old and vast in
bulk. Jane Welsh Carlyle is buried in its choir&mdash;for
she chose to lie beside her father in her long sleep.</p>

<p>The moorland road to Melrose is finely engineered,
following the hills in long sweeping lines with
few steep grades or sharp curves. In places it is
marked by rows of posts so that it may be followed
when covered by the snows. Melrose Abbey, familiar
from former visits, claims only a passing
glance, as we hasten on to its old-time rival at Jedburgh,
which is now somewhat off the beaten path
and few know of the real interest of the town or the
extent and magnificence of its abbey ruin, whose
massive tower and high walls, pierced by three tiers
of graceful windows, dominate any distant view of
the place.</p>

<p>We brought the car up sharply on the steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
hillside in front of the abbey and an old woman
in a nearby cottage called to us to &ldquo;gang right in&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll
find the keeper in the gardens.&rdquo; And we did&mdash;surprised
him at work with his flowers&mdash;a hale
old man of seventy with bushy hair and beard, silver
white, and a hearty Scotch accent that wins
you at once. He dropped his garden tools and came
forward with a quick, elastic step, greeting us as if
we had been expected friends. When he espied
the lady member of our party, he began to cut roses
until he had made up quite a bouquet, which he
gallantly presented her. Then he began a panegyric
on Jedburgh and the abbey, assuring us that a stay
of several days would be necessary to get even an
idea of the ruins and the historic spots of the vicinity.
His face visibly fell when we told him we
must be off in an hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sic haste, sic haste to get
back to England! Ye should bide longer in old
Scotia and learn her history and her people. I grant
ye England is a great nation, but the Scotch is the
greater of the two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then his enthusiasm got the better of him, and
forgetting the abbey he began to point out the beauties
of the valley of the Jed, over which we had a
far-reaching view, and to recite snatches of the
poetry of Burns appropriate to the scene. I had
thought that I knew a little of the beauty and spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
of Burns, but it all seemed to take on new meaning
from the lips of the quaint old Scotsman. It was
worth a journey to Jedburgh, and a long one, to
hear him recite it. Then he began to point out the
things of interest about the abbey, and so many they
seemed to him that he had difficulty in choosing
which he should enlarge upon during our short stay.
He showed us the Norman doorway, the most elaborate
in the Kingdom, so remarkable that the Marquis
of Lothian, the owner of the abbey, has caused
an exact duplicate to be made in the wall near by
to preserve the wonderful detail nearly obliterated
in the original. He led us among the great pillars,
still intact, springing up into the mighty arches of
the nave, and pointed out the gracefulness of the
numerous windows with slender stone mullions.
There are many notable tombs, among them one
with a marble effigy of the late Marquis of Lothian,
a really superb work of art, by George Frederick
Watts. Nor did he forget the odd gravestones in
the churchyard with epitaphs in quaint and halting
verse, telling of the virtues of the long-forgotten
dead, of one of whom it was declared:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Here Lyes a Christian Bold and True,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
<span class="i0">An antipode to Babel&rsquo;s Creu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Friend to Truth, to Vice a Terrour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Lamp of Zeal opposing Errour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fought the Battels of the Lamb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Victory now Bears the Palm.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And there is another stone with a threat as
grim as that of the Bard of Avon, for the epitaph
expresses the wish that</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Whoever Removes this
        Stone<br />
Or causes it to be<br />
      Removed<br />
May he die the last of<br />
    All his Friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>The stone lies flat, above the grave, and our
guide declared,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had an unco hard time to get a photo of it
for my book, for I did na fancy moving it, to be
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your book? And have you written a book?&rdquo;
He was off in a moment and with almost boyish
enthusiasm brought forth a neat volume, &ldquo;Poetry
and Prose of Walter Laidlaw, F. S. A.,&rdquo; and we
found on later perusal that it has not a little of true
poetic fire, of which an example or two may not be
amiss. It is not strange that one so full of patriotism
and admiration for his native Scotland should deprecate
the tendency of her people to emigrate to foreign
lands, and he expostulates as follows:</p>

<p>Besides the poems, the book contains several
addresses and essays which show the bent of Mr.
Laidlaw&rsquo;s mind, among them, &ldquo;Robert Burns,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dr.
John Leyden,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Songs of Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Besides his literary achievements, we learned
that Mr. Laidlaw is a Fellow of the Scotch Antiquarian
Society and a recognized authority on the
antiquities of Jedburgh and vicinity. We left him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
with regret, and hope that some day our wanderings
may enable us to renew his acquaintance.</p>

<p>We followed the Teviot road to Kelso, a few
miles away, where the substantial and comfortable
appearance of the Cross Keys induced us to stop
for the night&mdash;after an investigation by which we
assured ourselves that conditions within accorded
with outward appearances, a practice to which we
had become more and more partial.</p>

<p>Kelso is situated at the junction of the Teviot
and the Tweed, and is surrounded by an exceedingly
picturesque country. A fine view is afforded
from the stone-arched bridge over the Tweed&mdash;westward
the Eildon Hills, beloved of Scott, are
visible in the blue distance, and, nearer at hand,
the moorish facade of Floors Castle, against a mass
of somber woods. The river is greatly broadened
here and the meeting of its waters with the Teviot
is celebrated in song and story. Of Kelso Abbey
little remains save the shattered central tower and a
few straggling walls. It was one of the smaller ecclesiastical
establishments of Scotland founded by
David I. in 1130 and was burned by the English
during the invasion of 1545.</p>

<p>Closely following the beautiful Tweed road,
which for the greater part of the distance to Coldstream
keeps in full view of the river, we re-cross
the border quite early on the following morning.</p>

MORE YORKSHIRE WANDERINGS</h2>

<p>Flodden Field lies adjacent to the road which
we pursued southward from the Tweed, but there
is little now to indicate the location of the historic
battlefield. Song and story have done much to immortalize
a conflict whose results were not especially
important or far-reaching&mdash;the world knows of it
chiefly through the vivid lines of &ldquo;Marmion.&rdquo; It
is not worth while to follow our hasty flight to the
south; we are again bound for the Yorkshire moors
and the distance we must cover ere night will not
admit of loitering.</p>

<p>At Chillingham Castle we see the herd of native
wild cattle made famous by Landseer&rsquo;s picture.
The keeper led us into the park within a hundred
yards of a group of animals, which have become
so tame that they took no notice of our presence. The
cattle are white, with long curving horns and black
muzzles, and the purity of the stock is carefully
maintained. The herd is believed to be a direct descendant
of the wild ox of Europe, the progenitor
of our domestic cattle, and its preservation is quite
analogous to the few remaining buffaloes in Amer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>ica.
The animals retain many peculiarities of their
wild state; one of the most remarkable of these is
the habit which the young calves have of dropping
suddenly to the ground when surprised. The bulls
are often dangerous and it is related that King Edward,
when Prince of Wales, killed one of the animals,
arresting with a well-aimed shot its savage
charge toward him. Evidently the present prince
did not care to repeat his father&rsquo;s experience, for he
had been at Chillingham a few days before and
declined the opportunity offered him by the Earl
of Tankerville of slaying the king of the herd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E said &rsquo;e &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t time,&rdquo; explained the keeper
with an air of disgust that showed he looked on
the prince&rsquo;s excuse as a mere subterfuge.</p>

<p>On a former occasion we had failed to gain
admittance to Alnwick Castle, owing to a visit of
the king the previous day. We were more successful
this time and were conducted through the
portions usually shown to visitors, chiefly the remaining
parts of the old fortress&mdash;the &ldquo;castle good&rdquo;
that in early days &ldquo;threatened Scotland&rsquo;s wastes.&rdquo;
The home of the warlike Percys for many generations,
few castles in England have figured more
in ballad and story and few have been the center of
more stirring scenes. But the old castle is almost lost
in the palace of today, upon which the late Duke
of Northumberland is said to have expended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
enormous sum of three hundred and sixty thousand
pounds sterling. The walls at present enclose an
area of five acres and it would be hard to imagine
more pleasing vistas of forest and meadowland than
those which greet one from the battlements. The
great park is worthy of the castle, and taken altogether
there is perhaps no finer feudal estate in
England.</p>

<p>From Alnwick to Newcastle and from Newcastle
to Darlington the road is familiar; only an occasional
town or village interferes with our flight to
the southward. Newcastle, with its bad approaches
and crowded, slippery streets, causes the greatest
loss of time, but we make it up on the broad, level
stretch of the Great North Road to Darlington. At
Richmond we leave the lowlands and strike directly
across the rough moorland road to Leyburn in
Wensleydale.</p>

<p>Here in the remote Yorkshire hills is one of
the most romantic bits of England and within a comparatively
small space is much of historic interest.
Shall we go to Bolton Castle, which we see off
yonder, grim and almost forbidding in the falling
twilight? Its jagged towers and broken battlements
are outlined darkly against the distant hills; indeed,
in the dim light it seems almost a part of the hills
themselves. We follow the rough narrow road that
dwindles almost to a footpath as it approaches the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
village. Our car splashes through a rapid, unbridged
little river, climbs the steep bank, creeps through
tangled thickets, until it emerges into the main street
of Castle Bolton, if a wide grass-grown road with a
few lichen-covered cottages on either side may be
dignified with the name. At the end of the street,
towering over the slate-roofed hovels about it, is the
castle, its walls in fairly good repair and three of its
four original towers still standing. The fourth crumbled
and collapsed from the battering Cromwell
gave it&mdash;for even this remote fortress in the moors
did not escape the vengeance of the Protector.</p>

<p class="caption">CASTLE BOLTON, WENSLEYDALE, YORKSHIRE.</p>
</div>

<p>Bolton Castle, nevertheless, is better preserved
than the majority of those which have been abandoned
to ruin; the great entrance hall, some of the
stairways, the room of state and many chambers
are still intact. One may climb the winding stairs
and from the towers look down upon the mass of
ruined grandeur&mdash;sagging and broken roofs, vacant
doorways and windows and towers whose floors
have fallen away&mdash;the melancholy work of time and
weather, for these have chiefly affected the castle
since it was dismantled by its captors. One is relieved
to turn from such a scene to the narrow green
valley through which the river runs and out
beyond it to the wide prospect of brown hills with
gray villages and solitary cottages.</p>

<p>The history of Bolton Castle is long and varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>&mdash;too
long to tell in detail. It was built in the
twelfth century by Richard, the first Lord Scrope,
founder of the family, which figured so largely in
the fierce struggles of the northern border. From
that time to the death of the last representative of
the family in 1630, Bolton Castle was almost continually
the center of stirring scenes. The Archbishop
of York in 1405 was a Scrope, and he
preached a fiery sermon denouncing the reigning
King Henry as an usurper. The bold churchman
lost his head for his temerity, but his execution sowed
the seed of the long and terrible wars of the Roses.
Nor will the reader of &ldquo;Marmion&rdquo; forget Scott&rsquo;s
reference to &ldquo;Lord Scrope of Bolton, stern and
stout,&rdquo; who with &ldquo;all Wensleydale did wend&rdquo; to
join the English at Flodden Field. The closing
scene came like the closing scene of many an English
castle, when Col. Scrope, the last owner, was compelled
to surrender to the forces of Parliament and
the castle was dismantled. Since then it has stood
stern and lonely in the Yorkshire hills, and nearly
three centuries of decay have added to the ruin
wrought by the captors.</p>

<p>But there is a roselight of romance that enwraps
the shattered towers of Bolton, for does not
the moorland ruin call up a thousand memories of
Mary Stuart, yet in the flower of her youth, ere long
years of imprisonment had stolen the color from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
face and touched it with the shade of melancholy
that seldom left it? Here was her first prison; she
came as an unwilling guest after her ill-advised visit
to Carlisle in 1568, and remained a charge of Lord
Scrope for nearly two years. The room she occupied
is large and gloomy, with but one small window
looking westward over the hills&mdash;the same window,
legend declares, by which she escaped from the
castle, only to be shortly recaptured by Lord Scrope&rsquo;s
retainers. Her captivity at Bolton, while less rigorous
than in later years, was none the less a captivity,
and while she was allowed to go hawking, she was
always under close surveillance. Very likely she
did try to escape, for in such an escapade the unhappy
queen never lacked for accomplices, even
among her gaolers. But fate was ever unkind to
Mary Stuart, and though many times her fortune
seemed evenly balanced, some lack of judgment on
part of herself or her followers thwarted the plans for
regaining her liberty. They tell that in leaving Bolton
in this attempt, her friends followed the river
road to Leyburn when a dash over the moors to the
north might have insured success. It all seems very
real to one who stands in the gloomy apartment at
twilight and looks from the window down the steep
narrow road leading to the valley&mdash;no doubt the
one Mary followed in her effort to get out of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
arch-enemy&rsquo;s clutches, which ended in such heart-breaking
failure.</p>

<p>But it is waxing late and we will descend the
same hill and follow the same road to Leyburn.
Leyburn is gray and bleak in the falling night, with
a wide bare market place paved with rough cobblestones,
shorn, alas, a few decades ago, of its fine
old market cross and town hall&mdash;in a spirit of &ldquo;improvement!&rdquo;
The prospect for good cheer is far
from flattering, but we must stop in Leyburn perforce.
The Bolton Arms seems to promise the best,
but it is full and the Golden Lion offers the only
alternative. It is a typical second-class village inn,
not overly clean. It appears more of an alehouse
than hotel, for a crowd of villagers and farmers is
tippling at the bar.</p>

<p>Directly across the river from Leyburn is Middleham,
the old-time capital of Wensleydale and one
of the quaintest and least modernized towns it was
our good fortune to see. The drab-colored buildings
straggle up the hill upon whose crest sits Middleham
Castle, grim, vast and wholly ruinous. And
after wandering through the maze of shattered walls
and tottering towers, it seemed to us that here was
the very ideal of ruined castles. We had seen
many of them, but none more awe-inspiring, none
more suggestive of the power of the cataclysm which
left such fortresses, seemingly impregnable as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
hills themselves, in shapeless wreck and ruin. Here
and there the ivy and wall flower mantled the nakedness
of the mouldering stone, and a stout sapling of
several years&rsquo; growth had fastened its roots in the
deep mould high on one of the towers. Truly,
Cromwell did his work well at Middleham. Such
a stronghold could be dealt with only by gunpowder
mines, which were responsible for the cracked and
sundered walls and the shapeless masses of stone and
mortar which have never been cleared away.</p>

<div class="center">
<a name="bw_30" id="bw_30"></a><img src="images/bw_30.jpg" width="600" height="421" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MIDDLEHAM CASTLE, WENSLEYDALE.</p>
</div>

<p>There are memories connected with Middleham
Castle as grim as the ruin itself; for with them is
intertwined the name of Richard of Gloucester, the
hunchback whose crimes, wrought into the imperishable
lines of Shakespeare, have horrified the world.
When he came here the castle was owned by the
Nevilles, and here he married Anne, the daughter
of the house, and thus became possessed of the estate.
Here his only son, for whom he committed his unspeakable
crimes, was born and here his ambitions
were blasted by the boy&rsquo;s early death.</p>

<p>But it is no task of mine to tell the story of
Richard III.&mdash;only to recall his associations with
Middleham. And we noted on one of the two ancient
town crosses the rudely carved figure of a boar,
the emblem of this ruthless king. Altogether, Middleham
is very unique&mdash;old-world describes it better
than any other term, perhaps. There is scarcely a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
jarring note of any kind; the only thing approaching
mediocrity and seemingly much out of place, is the
Victoria Jubilee Fountain. And the customs of
the town still have a savor of medievalism&mdash;bulls
were baited within the memory of living men.</p>

<p>The thought that first occurs, when one learns
that Jervaulx Priory is not far from Middleham, is
of Prior Aylmer and &ldquo;Ivanhoe&rdquo;&mdash;showing how the
creations of the Wizard of the North often take precedence
in one&rsquo;s mind over actual history&mdash;nay,
rather have supplanted historical knowledge altogether,
for we know nothing of the history of Jervaulx
and will not take the pains to learn. It is
enough to wander through its grounds, now kept
with all possible care and neatness&mdash;every moss-grown
stone replaced as nearly as possible in its
original position and every detail of the abbey
marked with exactness on the sward&mdash;and to know
that the old story of monastic poverty, pomp and
downfall has been repeated here. It is near the
roadside and though private property, one may easily
gain access by application at the keeper&rsquo;s cottage.
The ruins are scanty indeed&mdash;little more than mere
outlines of the abbey church and monastery and a
few isolated columns and fragments of wall is to be
seen&mdash;but the landscape gardener has come to the
rescue and out of the scattered fragments has wrought
an harmonious and pleasing effect. The situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
is one of surpassing loveliness, just at the foot of the
hills on the river Ure, which rushes between almost
precipitous banks, over which its tributaries fall in
glittering cascades. The soft summer air is murmurous
with their music and the song of birds. There
is no one but ourselves on the ground; no guide is
with us to drone over prosaic history and to point
out nave and transept&mdash;and this and that. As we
wander almost dreamily about, we come very near
to the spirit of monastic days. It is easy to imagine
the old-time state of the abbey under Prior Aylmer,
&ldquo;when the good fathers of Jervaulx drank sweet
wines and lived on the fat of the land.&rdquo; Even in
that halcyon time it is doubtful if the surroundings
were half so lovely as today.</p>

<p>But we have mused long enough at Jervaulx&mdash;&ldquo;Jervo,&rdquo;
as the railway company officially declares
it; &ldquo;Jarvey,&rdquo; as the natives perversely term it. The
day is still young and an uninterrupted run over the
winding moorland road brings us to Ripon before
noon. The low square-topped towers of the cathedral
break on our view as we descend the hill to the
Ure, upon whose banks Ripon sits.</p>

<p>Ripon Cathedral is well-nigh forgotten by pilgrims
who would see the great Yorkshire churches&mdash;so
far is it surpassed by York Minster and Beverley.
But after all, it is an imposing church and of great
antiquity, for a monastery was established on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
present site in the seventh century and St. Wilfred,
the famous Archbishop of York, built the minster.
Of this ancient building the crypt still remains, and
to see it we followed the verger down a steep, narrow
flight of stairs into a series of dungeonlike apartments
beneath the forward end of the nave.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most curious relic is St. Wilfred&rsquo;s
Needle, a small window in the thick wall of the
crypt, and various merits have been attributed to
anyone who could pass through it. In old days this
was proof of innocence against any charge of crime;
but just now the young woman who can perform the
somewhat acrobatic feat will be married within a
year&mdash;rather a discrimination against the more
buxom maidens.</p>

<p>About four hundred years after the founding
of the Saxon monastery, the present church was
built; but it was not until 1836 that it was elevated
to the rank of a cathedral. Like York Minster,
Ripon is singularly devoid of tombs of famous men,
though there are many fine monuments and brasses
to the noble families of the vicinity. The architecture
is strangely mixed, owing to the many alterations
that have been made from time to time. The
exterior must have been far more imposing before
the removal of the wooden spires which rose above
the towers. Ripon is a quiet, old-world market
town, progressive in its way, but having little re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>source
other than the rich agricultural country around
it. There are many quaint streets and odd corners
that attract the lover of such things. A queer relic
of the olden days that arouses the curiosity of the
visitor is the blowing of a horn at nine in the evening
before the town cross by the constable. The
sojourner will not be at a loss for comfortable entertainment,
since the Unicorn Hotel fulfills the best
traditions of English inns.</p>

<p>To come within hailing distance of York
means that we cannot remain away from that charming
old city; and the early afternoon finds us passing
Bootham Bar. The rest of the day we give to a
detailed study of the minster&mdash;our fourth visit, nor
are we weary of York Minster yet.</p>

<p>Pontefract&mdash;the Pomfret of olden time&mdash;lies
about twenty miles southwest of York. Its very
name takes us back to Roman times&mdash;Pontem
Fractem, the place of the broken bridge. It is a
town that figured much in early English history and
its grim old castle may hold the mystery of the
death of King Richard II. We came here under
lowering skies, and passing the partly ruined church,
climbed the steep hill where the castle&mdash;or rather
the scanty remnant of it&mdash;still stands. Verily, &ldquo;ruin
greenly dwells&rdquo; about the old fortress of Pontefract;
the walls were laden heavily with ivy, the
greensward covered the floor of the keep, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
courtyard has been converted into a public garden.
There is so little left that it would require a vivid
imagination to reconstruct the strong and lordly
fortress, which endured no fewer than three sieges
during the civil war. The first resulted disastrously
to the Parliamentary forces and the second was
successful only after a long period and very heavy
losses, and even then the garrison was given the
honors of the war; yet after all this strenuous work,
the castle was again lost to the Royalists through a
trifling bit of strategy.</p>

<p>The commander became so negligent through
a false sense of security that a handful of adventurers
gained admission to the castle, and driving out
the few soldiers who happened to be inside&mdash;most
of the garrison was quartered in the town&mdash;possessed
themselves of the fortress. A third siege was
thus made necessary and such was the strength of
the castle that nearly a year elapsed before it finally
fell&mdash;holding out for some time after Charles was
beheaded. Even then, favorable terms were again
granted to the defenders, though Col. Morris, who
devised the successful capture, and five others, were
specifically excepted from the amnesty. Much to
the disgust of the captors, Morris escaped for the
time, though a little later he was taken and hanged
at York. Thus ended the active history of Pontefract
Castle, but it was considered dangerous to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Commonwealth and was almost completely razed,
the walls being mined with gunpowder.</p>

<p class="caption">RUINS OF PONTEFRACT CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Pontefract was undoubtedly the prison to
which the Duke of Lancaster consigned King
Richard II.,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;That disastrous king on whom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fate, like a tempest, early fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dark secret of whose doom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The keep of Pomfret kept full well.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And yet it is not certain that Richard perished while
a prisoner in the castle. A tradition exists that he
escaped and lived many years an humble peasant.
Pontefract was a very storm center in the wars of
the Roses, for almost within sight of its towers was
fought the battle of Towton Moor, the bloodiest
conflict that ever took place on English soil.</p>

<p>But it would take a volume to record the
vicissitudes that have befallen the mouldering ruin
at our feet. The rain is falling more heavily; let us
on to Wakefield, whose spire we might easily see
were it not for the gray veil which hides the landscape.
For Wakefield spire is the loftiest in Yorkshire&mdash;a
slender, pointed shaft rising to a height of
two hundred and forty-seven feet over a much altered
church that was elevated to the rank of cathedral
in 1888. As it now stands, the interior is
chiefly Perpendicular, though there are many touches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of the Decorated and Early English styles. It is
characterized by grace and lightness, giving an altogether
pleasing effect. The windows exhibit as
fine modern glass as we saw in the Kingdom, and
go far to prove that the disrepute into which modern
glass has fallen is largely due to lack of artistic
taste and a desire for cheapness. Such windows as
those at Wakefield are far from a reproach on the
art of the stained-glass maker. So much has the
church been restored and added to that it gives as
a whole an impression of newness that seems strange
in an English cathedral&mdash;for there has been no cathedral
built in England since St. Paul&rsquo;s, more than
two hundred years ago.</p>

<p>When we come to Barnsley, a few miles to the
south, the rain, which has gradually increased, is
falling in torrents, and we resolve to take respite
from the cold and damp for our belated luncheon.
We seek out the King&rsquo;s Head, for an English friend
has told us that twenty-five years ago this hotel was
famous for the best mutton chop in England. Traditions
never die in Britain, and we doubt not the
King&rsquo;s Head still retains its proud distinction. It
does not, however, present an especially attractive
appearance; it is rather dingy and time-worn, but
any place might seem a little dreary on such a day.
Yes, the King&rsquo;s Head still serves the Barnsley chop,
and we will have it, though we must wait a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
hour for it. And the recollection of the luncheon
comes like a gleam of sunshine into a dark, rainy day,
and effaces all memory of the first unfavorable impression
of the King&rsquo;s Head.</p>

<p>A Barnsley chop defies all description; its
mighty dimensions might be given, its juicy tenderness
might be descanted upon; all the language at
the epicure&rsquo;s command might be called into action,
and yet, after all, only he who has actually eaten a
Barnsley chop would have an adequate idea of its
savory excellence. O, yes! They imitate it at other
hotels, both in and out of Barnsley, so said the manageress,
but after all, the King&rsquo;s Head alone can
prepare the original and only Barnsley chop; it alone
has devised the peculiar process whereby the truly
wonderful result is obtained. Verily, after eating
it we sallied forth into the driving rain feeling something
of the spirit of the ancient Roman who declared,
&ldquo;Fate cannot harm me&mdash;I have dined today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three or four miles out of Barnsley on a byway
off the Doncaster road is the village of Darfield,
whose church illustrates the interest one may so often
find in out-of-the-way spots in England. Thither
we drove through the heavy rain, and as we stopped
in front of the church at the end of the village street,
a few of the natives who happened to be abroad
paused under dripping umbrellas to stare at us. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
do not wonder at their astonishment, for from their
point of view persons motoring in search of old
churches on such a day might well have their sanity
questioned.</p>

<p>The ceiling is painted blue, with stars and
feathery clouds&mdash;clearly a representation of the
heavens&mdash;and it seemed an age since we had seen
them, too. There are many elaborate carvings; the
massive Jacobean cover over the baptismal font, the
fine black-oak bench-ends of the seventeenth century,
and a splendid coffer in the vestry, are all treasures
worthy of notice. A Bible with heavy wooden
covers is chained to a solid oaken stand&mdash;suggestive
of the days when a man&rsquo;s piety might lead him to
steal the rare copies of the Scripture. A beautifully
wrought though scarred and dilapidated alabaster
tomb has recumbent figures of a knight and his lady
in costumes of the time of Richard II., and another
tomb bears some very quaint devices, among them
an owl with a crown upon its head.</p>

<p>It is our third visit to Doncaster, and the giant
church tower has become a familiar object. Its very
stateliness is exaggerated by the dead level of the
town and today it rises dim and vast against the
leaden, rain-swept sky, but though it is easily the
most conspicuous object in the town, the fine old
church does not constitute Doncaster&rsquo;s chief claim
to fame. Here is the horse-racing center of York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>shire,
and on its &ldquo;Leger Day&rdquo; it is probably the
liveliest town in England. The car shops of the
Great Northern Railway keep it quietly busy for
the rest of the year. But as the racing center of a
horse-loving shire, it would be strange if it had not
acquired during the ages a reputation for conviviality.
That it had such a reputation a century or
more ago is evidenced by the example of its mayor,
set forth by a ballad-maker of the period:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The Doncaster mayor he sits in his chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His mills they merrily go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nose doth shine with drinking wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the gout is in his great toe.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We pass on to the southward and pause in the
main street of the quiet village of Scrooby, just on
the Yorkshire border, where good authorities insist
the idea of American colonization was first conceived.
Here Elder Brewster, one of the chief
founders of the Plymouth Colony, was born in 1567,
and here he passed his boyhood days. The manor-house
where he lived and where he met Rev. John
Robinson and William Bradford is no longer standing;
but it is not unreasonable to suppose that the
plan of leaving England for the new world may
have been consummated here by these earnest men,
who held themselves persecuted for righteousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>&rsquo;
sake. After varied fortunes they sailed on the Mayflower
in 1620.</p>

<p>We are now leaving old Yorkshire with its
waste moorlands, its wide, fertile valleys, its narrow,
picturesque dales, its quaint old towns and modern
cities, its castles and abbeys, and, more than all, its
associations of the past which reach out even to the
shores of our native land, and we leave it with the
keenest regret. It has fallen to us as it has to few
to traverse the highways and byways of every section
of the great county, and I can but be sensible as
to how feebly my pages reflect the things that
charmed us. If an American and a stranger is so
impressed, how must the native Englishman feel
when wandering among these memorials of the
past? I cannot close my chapter more fitly than to
quote the words of one who in poetic phrase has
written much of Yorkshire and its history:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But any man will spend a month in wandering
round Yorkshire, with ears awake to all the great
voices of the past, and eyes open to the beauty which
is so peculiarly English, he will find the patriotic
passion roused again, real and living; and thenceforth
the rivers and the glaciers of other lands will
be to him no more than the parks and palaces of
other men compared with the white gateway and
the low veranda which speaks to him of home.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV">XV</a><br />
ROUND ABOUT WILTSHIRE</h2>

<p>Our run from Nottingham to Oxford was uneventful,
for we roved rather at random for the day
through the delightful Midland country. At Nottingham
one will find the Victoria is quite up to the
standard of station-hotel excellence in England
and the rates refreshingly low. The city itself will
not detain one long, for the great wave of modern
progress that has inundated it has swept away most
of its ancient landmarks. The old castle, once the
key to the Northlands, has been superseded by a
palatial structure which now serves as museum and
art gallery. Unless one would see factories, machine
shops and lace-making works, there will be little to
keep him in Nottingham.</p>

<p>We follow the well-surfaced road to the southeast,
and though steep in places, its hills afford splendid
views of the landscape. The rain interferes
much with the prospect, but in the lulls we catch
glimpses of long reaches of meadowland dotted with
solitary trees, rich with the emerald greenness that
follows summer rain in England.</p>

<p>Melton Mowbray has a proud distinction, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
does not the infallible Baedeker accord it the honor
of being the &ldquo;hunting capital of the Midlands?&rdquo;
And the assertion that it is famous for its pork pies
very appropriately follows, a matter of cause and
effect, perhaps, for the horde of hungry huntsmen
who congregate in the town would hardly be satisfied
with anything less substantial than an English
pork pie. Melton Mowbray has a competitor in
Market Harborough, some twenty miles farther,
where we stopped for luncheon at a pleasant wayside
inn. Each of these towns has a population of
about seven thousand, chiefly dependent upon the
hunting industry&mdash;if I may use such a term&mdash;and
certain it is that fox hunting is about the only vocation
toward which many of the Midland squires are
at all industriously inclined. One is simply astounded
at the hold the sport has in England and the amount
of time and money devoted to it; a leading authority
estimates that not less than nine million pounds is
spent yearly by the hunters. In a summer tour one
sees comparatively little of it, but in the autumn and
winter these towns doubtless exhibit great activity,
and their streets, crowded with red-coated huntsmen
and packs of yelping dogs, must be decidedly picturesque.</p>

<p>From Market Harborough a straight, narrow
road carried us swiftly southward toward Northampton
and we passed through the Bringtons, of whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
memories of the Washingtons I have written in an
earlier chapter. The rain, which had been falling
fitfully during the day, ceased and the sun came out
with a brilliancy that completely transformed the
landscape. All about us was the dense green of the
trees and meadowlands, bejeweled with sparkling
raindrops and dashed with the gold of the ripening
grain, stretching away until lost in the purple mist
of the distance. Even the roadside pools glowed
crimson and gold, and altogether the scene was one
of transcendent beauty and freshness. It was exhilarating
indeed as our open car swept over the fine
Oxford road, passing through the ancient towns of
Towcester, Buckingham and Bicester. There is no
more beautiful or fertile country in the Island than
that around Oxford, and it was a welcome change
to see it basking in the sunshine after our dull days
on the Yorkshire moors.</p>

<p>One never wearies of Oxford, and the Randolph
Hotel is worth a run of many miles to reach at nightfall.
Aristocratic, spacious and quiet, with an indefinable
atmosphere of the great universities about
it, it appeals to both the bodily and aesthetic senses
of the wayfarer&mdash;but Oxford, with all its interest
and charm, has no place in this chronicle, and we
leave it, however loath, in the early morning. We
hasten over the Berkshire Hills through Abingdon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
into Wiltshire, where there is much to engage our
attention.</p>

<p>Swindon, the first town we encounter after
passing the border, is an up-to-date city of fifty
thousand people and the newness everywhere apparent,
the asphalt pavement and the numerous tram
lines impress one with its similarity to live American
towns. We learn that it is practically a creation
of the Great Western Railway, whose shops give
employment to a large proportion of the population.
Clearly, there is nothing for us in Swindon and we
hasten on to Chippenham, which has the traditions
which Swindon so wofully lacks. It is a staid old
town of six thousand and was important in Saxon
times, having frequent mention in the chronicles of
Alfred&rsquo;s wars with the Danes. Strange indeed the
mutations of time&mdash;strange it seems that the now
decadent and negligible Denmark once sent her &ldquo;fair-haired
despots of the sea&rdquo; into this remote section of
the present mistress of the seas. The town is full of
odd old houses and it is the center of one of the
most interesting spots in England, as I hope to be
able to show. But its hotel would hardly invite a
long sojourn; we stop for luncheon at the Angel,
and are placed at a large table with several rather
red-faced gentlemen who discuss horses and hunting
dogs as vigorously as a lively onslaught on the host&rsquo;s
vintage and good cheer permits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>Lacock is only four miles away and they tell
us that we should see the abbey; but they do not
tell us that the village itself is worth a day&rsquo;s journey
and that the abbey is only secondary. They do not
tell us this, because no one about Lacock knows it.
The utter unconsciousness and genuineness of the
village is not its least charm. Lacock never dreams
of being a show place or tourist resort; but despite its
unconsciousness, anyone who has seen England as
we have seen it will know that Lacock is not easily
matched for its wealth of old stone and timber houses
and its quaint, genuine antiquity. It is perhaps a
trifle severe and its picturesqueness is of a melancholy
and somber kind&mdash;thatched roofs are few, ivy-clad
walls and flower gardens are wanting; there is little
color save an occasional red roof to relieve the all-pervading
gray monotone. Its timbered houses are
not the imitations one sees so often, even in England,
or the modernized old buildings shining in black and
white paint, but the genuine article, with weathered
oak timbers and lichen-covered brick. There are
many projecting upper stories and sharp gables with
casement windows of diamond panes set in rusty
iron frames. The Lacock of today is truly a voice
from the past. It must have been practically the same
two or three hundred years ago. Its houses, its
streets, its church and its very atmosphere carry one
back to the England of Shakespeare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a village seems a fitting introduction to
the abbey at whose gates it sits; and the abbey itself,
gray and ancient like the village, is one of the
most perfect monastic buildings in England. Nowhere
else did we see what seemed to us a more appropriate
home for romance than this great rambling
pile of towered and gabled buildings, with a hundred
odd nooks and corners, each of which might
well have a story of its own. It is opened freely to
visitors by its owner, Mr. Talbot, himself an antiquarian
of note, who is glad to share his unbounded
delight in the old place with anyone who may care
to come. We were shown in detail the parts of the
abbey that have a special historic and architectural
interest. It is guarded carefully and the atmosphere
of antiquity jealously preserved. Even the stone
steps of the main entrance are grass-grown and moss-covered&mdash;&ldquo;and
he wont let us clean them up,&rdquo; said
our guide.</p>

<p>Inside there are many fine apartments and notable
relics. The arched cloisters, the chapter house,
the refectory and other haunts of the nuns, are in
quite the original state. The immense stone fishtank
from a solid block sixteen feet long and the
great bronze cauldron show that good cheer was
quite as acceptable to the nuns as to their brethren.
But the exterior of the abbey and the beautiful
grounds surrounding it impressed us most. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
about were splendid trees and plots of shrubbery,
and the Bristol Avon flows through the park. We
heard what we thought the rush of its waters, but
our guide told us that it was the quaking aspens
which fringe the river banks, keeping up their age-long
sigh that their species had supplied the wood
for the cross. No day is so still that you do not
hear them in summer time. We passed around the
building to note from different viewpoints its quaint
outlines and its great rambling facades with crowded,
queerly assorted gables, battlemented towers and
turrets, and mysterious corners, all combining to
make it the very ideal of the abbey of romance.
How easy, when contemplating it in the dim twilight
or by the light of a full moon, for the imagination to
re-people it with its old-time habitants; and surely,
if the ghosts of the gray nuns ever return to their
earthly haunts, Lacock Abbey must have such visitants.</p>

<p class="caption">LACOCK ABBEY.</p>
</div>

<p>But enough of these vagaries&mdash;one might yield
himself up to them for days in such surroundings. I
will not mar them with sober history, in any event,
though Lacock has quite enough of that. The guide-book
which you may get at the abbey lodge for two-pence
tells its story and I have tried to tell only what
we saw and felt.</p>

<p>At the postcard shop, where we buy a few
pictures and souvenirs of Lacock, the young woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
tells us of other Wiltshire nooks that we should
see. Do we know of Sloperton Cottage, of Bromham
Church, of Corsham, of Yatton Keynell and
Castle Combe? These are only a few, in fact, but
they are the ones that strike our fancy most and we
thank our informant, who follows us to point out the
roads. And never had we more need of such assistance,
for our search for Sloperton Cottage involves
us in a maze of unmarked byways that wind between
tall hedges and overarching trees.</p>

<p>And what of Sloperton Cottage? Are you,
dear reader, so ignorant as we were, not to know
that Tom Moore, the darling poet of Erin, lived in
Sloperton Cottage with his beloved Bessie for a
third of a century and that both are buried at Bromham
Church near at hand? One had surely thought
to find his grave in the &ldquo;ould sod&rdquo; rather than in the
very heart of rural England; but so it is; and
after much inquiry we enter the lonely lane that
leads to Sloperton Cottage and pause before the
long low building, heavily mantled with ivy and
roses, though almost hidden from the road by the
tall hedge in front. We had been told that it is the
private home of two ladies, sisters of the owner,
and we have no thought of intruding in such a case&mdash;but
a neat maid appears at the gateway as we look,
no doubt rather longingly, at the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;would be pleased
to have you come in and see the cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here is unexpected good fortune, and coming
voluntarily to us, we feel free to accept the invitation.
We see the cottage and gardens, which are much
the same as when occupied by the poet, though
some of the furniture has been replaced. The
garden to the rear, sweet with old-fashioned flowers,
we are told was a favorite resort of the author of
&ldquo;Lalla Rookh&rdquo; and that he composed much of his
verse here, lying on his back and gazing at the sky
through over-arching branches. The cottage is
quite unpretentious and the whole place is so cozy
and secluded as to be an ideal retreat for the muses,
and as an English writer has observed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be an unfeeling person who could
stand today before this leafy cottage, so snugly
tucked away by a shady Wiltshire lane, without
some stirring of the pulse, if only for the sake of the
melodies. If they are not great, they are the most
felicitous and feeling English verse, taken as a whole,
ever set to music, and are certainly world-famous
and probably immortal. No one would wish to
submit &ldquo;Dear Harp of My Country&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oft in the
Stilly Night&rdquo; to the cold light of poetic criticism.
But when the conscientious expert has finished with
&ldquo;Lalla Rookh&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Loves of the Angels&rdquo; and
consigned them to oblivion, he goes into another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
chamber, so to speak, and relaxes into unrestrained
praise of the melodies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moore must have written much of the &ldquo;melodies&rdquo;
at Sloperton Cottage, but before he came here
his fame had been made by his oriental poems,
whose music and glitter caused them to be greatly
over-estimated at the time. As we take our leave
and thank the ladies for the courtesy, we are told
that the cottage is to let and that we may so inform
any of our friends. We do so herewith and can
add our unqualified personal indorsement of Sloperton
Cottage.</p>

<p>Bromham Church, one of the most graceful of
the country churches we have seen, is near at hand.
It stands against a background of fine trees with a
hedge-surmounted stone wall in front. It is mainly
in the Perpendicular style and a slender spire rises
from its square battlemented tower. The stained
windows are very large, each with many tall upright
stone mullions; one is a memorial to the poet and
another to his wife, whose memory still lingers as one
of the best-loved women of the countryside. She
survived the poet, who died in 1852, by fourteen
years. They lie buried just outside the north wall
of the church. The grave is marked by a tall Celtic
cross, only recently erected, and the occasion was
observed by a gathering of distinguished Irishmen
in honor of the memory of their poet. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
pedestal of the cross is graven a verse which truly
gives Moore&rsquo;s best claim to remembrance:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Dear Harp of my Country, in darkness I found thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cold chain of silence had hung o&rsquo;er thee long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When proudly, my own Island Harp, I unbound thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gave all thy chords to light, freedom and song.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And indeed it is the harp of his country that is now
heard, and not his labored oriental poems.</p>

<p class="caption">BROMHAM CHURCH, BURIAL PLACE OF THOMAS MOORE.</p>
</div>

<p>It is a very quiet, retired country lane that we
followed to Corsham, famous for the stately seat
of Lord Metheun. Corsham Court is an Elizabethan
mansion of vast extent which has many noted pictures
in its galleries, among them &ldquo;Charles I. on
Horseback,&rdquo; which is counted the masterpiece of
Van Dyck. Near the park entrance is the almshouse,
with its timeworn gables of yellow stone
against the dull red of the tile roofing. Just inside
is the chapel, always present in early English buildings,
a fine Jacobean room with a double-deck pulpit
and a gallery behind an intricately carved oaken
screen. One finds these almshouses in many of the
older English towns. They were founded some
centuries ago by charitably inclined persons who
left legacies for the purpose, and are maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
for a limited number of old people&mdash;women at Corsham&mdash;who
are admitted under certain carefully
specified conditions. Each inmate has a small, fairly
comfortable room and usually a little garden plot.
We saw such houses at Coventry, Campden and
Corsham&mdash;all substantially built and unique in their
architecture. St. Cross at Winchester and Leicester&rsquo;s
Hospital at Warwick are similar institutions.
There is always a long waiting-list of applicants for
the charity.</p>

<p>At the queer little village of Yatton Keynell,
as odd and uncouth as its name, we found another
of the melancholy instances so common in England
of the degeneration of a fine manor into a slovenly
farm tenement. We drove into the ill-kept farmyard
and picked our way carefully through the debris
to the front entrance, a solid oaken door under
a curious little porch. The house is a good example
of the substantial mansion of the old-time English
squire, and though still quite extensive, is of only
half its original size. It has a solid oak staircase
and many touches of its old-time beauty remain.
While it has no history or tradition, it is worthy a
visit from anyone interested in English domestic
architecture and in a rather melancholy phase of
social conditions.</p>

<p>A combe, in west of England parlance, is a
deep, ravinelike valley. Such a description certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
fits the site of Castle Combe, surely one of the loveliest
villages in Wiltshire, or all of England, for that
matter. We carefully descended a steep, narrow
road winding through the trees that cover the sharply
rising hillsides, and paused before the queer old
market cross of the little town. Nowhere did we
find a more perfect and secluded gem of rural England.
The market cross, whose quadrangular roof
of tile, with a tall slender shaft rising from the center,
is supported on four heavy stone pillars, looks
as if it had scarce been touched in the four hundred
years during which it has weathered sun and rain.
Near by is the solid little church with pinnacled and
embattled tower, still more ancient. Along shady
lanes leading from the market place are cozy thatched
cottages, bright with climbing roses and ivy, and
others of gray stone seem quite as bleak as the
cross itself. Nothing could be more picturesque
than the gateway to the adjoining park&mdash;the thatched
roof of the lodgekeeper&rsquo;s house sagging from the
weight of several centuries. On either side of the
village rise the steep, heavily wooded hills and from
the foot of the glen comes up the murmur of the
stream. Verily, there is an unknown England&mdash;the
guide-books have nothing of Castle Combe,
and unless the wayfarer comes upon it like ourselves,
he will miss one of the most charming bits of old-world
life in the Kingdom. And it is all uncon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>scious
of its charm; excepting an occasional incursion
of English trippers, visitors are few.</p>

<p>The road out of the valley runs along the
wooded glen, by the swift stream just below, until a
sharp rise brings us to the up-lands, where we enter
the main Bath road. And we are glad that the
close of our day&rsquo;s wanderings finds us so close to
Bath, for we may be sure of comfort at the Empire&mdash;though
we may expect to pay for it&mdash;and we
have stopped here often enough to form the acquaintance
so helpful to one in the average English hotel.
Bath is in Somerset, but the next morning we recross
the border and resume our pilgrimage in Wiltshire.</p>

<p>How lightly the rarest antiquities were valued
in England until yesterday is shown by the remarkable
history of the Saxon chapel at Bradford-on-Avon.
This tiny church, believed to be the oldest
in England, was completely lost among the surrounding
buildings; as the discoverer, Rev. Laurence
Jones, says: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>&ldquo;Hemmed in on every side by
buildings of one kind or another, on the north by a
large shed employed for the purposes of the neighbouring
woolen manufactory; on the south by a
coach-house and stables which hid the south side
of the chancel, and by a modern house built against
the same side of the nave; on the east by what was
formerly, as Leland tells us, &lsquo;a very fair house of the
building of one Horton, a rich clothier,&rsquo; the western
gable of which was within a very few feet of it,
and hid it completely from the general view&mdash;the
design and nature of the building entirely escaped
the notice of the archaeologist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About 1865 Rev. Jones, then Vicar of Bradford,
was led to his investigations by the accidental
discovery of stone figures, evidently rude Saxon carvings,
during some repairs to the school-room. From
this beginning the building was gradually disentangled
from the surrounding structures; excavations
were made and many old carvings unearthed, and
in short the chapel began to assume its present shape.
The history of the church is of course very obscure,
though Rev. Jones with great ingenuity and research
shows that there is good reason to believe that it was
founded by St. Aldhelm, who died in 709. If
this be true, the chapel is twelve hundred years old
and contests in antiquity with St. Augustine&rsquo;s of
Canterbury.</p>

<p>Architecturally, the little church is the plainest
possible&mdash;it comprises a tiny entrance porch, nave
and chancel. The most remarkable feature of the
nave is its great height as compared with its other
dimensions, being the same as its length, or about
twenty-five feet. The doors are very narrow, barely
wide enough for one person at a time, and windows
mere slits through which the sunlight struggled rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
weakly with the gloom of the interior. The chapel
is a regularly constituted Church of England and
services are held in it once a year. With all its
crudeness, it serves as one of the milestones of the
progress of a new order of things in Britain, and a
space of only three centuries separates this poor little
structure from the cathedrals!</p>

<p>The youth who acted as guide led us into his
cottage near at hand when we asked for picture cards
of the chapel. His eyes brightened noticeably when
he learned we were from America. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I am going there next spring; my brother is already
there and doing well. Do you know that more than
a hundred people have gone from Bradford to
America in the past year? And more are going.
There is no chance for a common man in England.&rdquo;
No chance for a common man in England!&mdash;How
often we heard words to that effect during our pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Bradford has another unique relic in the &ldquo;tithe
barn&rdquo; built in 1300, a long low structure with enormously
thick, heavily buttressed walls and ponderous
roof&mdash;solid oaken timbers overlaid with stone
slabs. Its capacious dimensions speak eloquently
of the tribute the monks were able to levy in the
good old days, for here the people who could not
contribute money brought their offerings in kind and
the holy fathers were apparently well prepared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
receive and care for anything of value. Today it
serves as a cow-barn for a nearby farmer.</p>

<p>We leave Bradford-on-Avon for Marlborough
over a fine though rather undulating road. We
pause at Devizes to read the astonishing inscription
on the town cross:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mayor and corporation of Devizes avail
themselves of the stability of this building to transmit
to future times the record of an awful event which
occurred in this market place in the year 1753,
hoping that such record may serve as a salutary
warning against the danger of impiously invoking
Divine vengeance or calling on the holy name of
God to conceal the devices of falsehood and fraud.
On Thursday, the 17th of January 1753, Ruth
Pierce of Pottern in this county agreed with three
other women to buy a sack of wheat in the market,
each paying her due proportion towards the same.
One of these women collecting the several quotas
of money, discovered a deficiency and demanded of
Ruth Pierce what was wanting to make good the
amount. Ruth Pierce protested that she had paid
her share and said she wished she might drop down
dead if she had not. She rashly repeated this awful
wish, when, to the consternation and terror of the
surrounding multitude, she instantly fell down and
expired, having the money concealed in her hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surely the citizens of Devizes, with such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
warning staring them in the face every day, must
be exemplary disciples of George Washington&mdash;and
what a discouraging place the town would be for
the headquarters of an American trust!</p>

<p>The town gets its name from having been a
division camp back in Roman days. It figured much
in the civil war, its castle, of which no traces now
remain, holding out for the king until taken by Cromwell
in person. There are in the town two of the
finest churches in Wiltshire, second only to Salisbury
Cathedral. Nor is it to be forgotten that the
parents of Sir Thomas Lawrence were at one time
keepers of the Bear Inn at Devizes, and the son acquired
his first fame by sketching the guests and
reciting poetry to them. He lived here until eighteen
years of age, when he entered the Royal Academy
at London.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to find at Avebury, a lonely
village a few miles farther on, relics of a pre-historic
stone circle that completely dwarf the giants of Stonehenge.
This great circle was about three-quarters
of a mile in circumference and three hundred years
ago was nearly perfect. The mighty relics were
destroyed by the unsentimental vandals of the
neighborhood, and it is said that most of the cottages
in the village were built from these stones. Some
of them were buried to clear the land of them! Barely
a dozen remain of more than six hundred mono<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>liths
that stood in the circle as late as the reign of
Elizabeth; and the destruction ceased only fifty
years ago. The stones are ruder and less symmetrical
than those of Stonehenge, but their individual
bulk averages greater&mdash;mighty fragments of rock
weighing from fifty to sixty tons each. The Avebury
circle is supposed to have been a temple of prehistoric
sun worshipers, but its crudity indicates that
it is far older than Stonehenge.</p>

<p>A short run across the downs soon brought us
to Marlborough, a name more familiar as that
of a dukedom than of a town. But the Duke of
Marlborough lives at Blenheim, forty miles away,
and has no connection with the Wiltshire town. Its
vicissitudes were those of almost any of the older
English towns, though it had the rare distinction of
having its castle destroyed before the time of Cromwell.
It has little of great antiquity, since a fire
two hundred and fifty years ago totally wiped out
the town that then existed. In the coaching days,
it was an important point on the London and Bath
road; and perhaps the motor car may bring back
something of its old-time prosperity. The Ailesbury
Arms, where we stopped for our belated lunch,
appeared to be a most excellent hotel and is the only
one I recollect which had a colored man in uniform at
the door.</p>

<p>Immediately adjoining Marlborough is Saver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>nake
Forest, on the estate of the Marquis of Ailesbury,
which is said to be the only forest of any extent
possessed by a subject. This park is sixteen
miles in circumference, and its chief glory is a straight
four-mile drive between rows of enormous beeches.
This splendid avenue is not &ldquo;closed to motors&rdquo; (the
inscription that greeted us at the entrance of so many
private parks), and our car carried us soberly enough
through the sylvan scene, which is diversified with
many grassy glades. There are several famous trees,
one of which, the King&rsquo;s Oak, is twenty-four feet
in circumference. Savernake is pleasant and impressive
in summer time, but its real beauty must
be most apparent in autumn, when, as an English
writer describes it, &ldquo;it is a blaze of crimson and
yellow&mdash;the long shadows and golden sunlight giving
the scene a painted, almost too brilliant effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is growing late and we must not loiter longer
by the way if we are to reach Bournemouth for the
night. We sweep across the great open Salisbury
Plain past Stonehenge and down the sweet vale of
the Avon until the majestic spire of Salisbury
pierces the sky. Then southward through Ringwood
to Christchurch, where we catch a glimpse of
the scant fragments of the castle and the abbey
church, with its melancholy memorial to Shelley.
A few minutes more on the fine ocean road brings
us into Bournemouth.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI">XVI</a><br />
DORSET AND THE ISLE OF WIGHT</h2>

<p>Of the hundreds of hotels whose hospitality
we enjoyed&mdash;or endured&mdash;in Britain, no other was
so barbarously gorgeous as the Royal Bath at
Bournemouth. The furnishings were rich, though
verging to some extent on the gaudy, and the whole
place had an air of oriental splendor about it made
the more realistic by &ldquo;fairy grottoes&rdquo; and gilded pagodas
on the grounds. It is a rather low building
of great extent, with wide, thickly carpeted halls in
which bronze and plaster statuettes and suits of old
plate armor are displayed. At the head of the stairs
a tablet enumerates a few of the patrons of quality&mdash;an
imposing list indeed&mdash;which we may partly transcribe
here. The large gilt letters solemnly assure
us that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>&ldquo;This Hotel has been patronised by H. R.
H. the PRINCE OF WALES, H. R. H. the
DUCHESS OF ALBANY, and other Members
of the ROYAL FAMILY: H. I. H. the EMPRESS
EUGENIE, H. M. the KING OF THE
BELGIANS, H. R. H. CROWN PRINCE OF
SWEDEN and NORWAY, H. R. H. the
CROWN PRINCESS OF DENMARK, H. R.
H. PRINCE ALBRECHT OF PRUSSIA,
Regent of Brunswick; the Leading Statesmen, and
the most Eminent and Distinguished Personages visiting
Bournemouth.&rdquo; Verily a list of notables that
might well overawe a common American citizen.</p>

<p>But after all, the pretensions of the Royal
Bath are not altogether unwarranted, for its foundation,
in 1838, marked the beginning of Bournemouth
itself. It is since then that this handsome watering-place&mdash;it
has no superior in the Kingdom&mdash;has come
into existence. In few other modern resort towns
has the original idea been so well carried out. The
pine trees planted by the early promoters now form
a grove through which runs the magnificent promenade
along the sea. The citizens are mainly of
the wealthier class and there are many fine private
residences. There are, of course, the usual adjuncts
of the watering-place, such as the amusement pier,
promenades, public gardens and palatial hotels.
The climate, which is as salubrious as that of Torquay,
brings to the town many people seeking
health. Bournemouth, of course, has little of history
or tradition. In the churchyard surrounding its imposing
modern church is buried Mary Wollstonecraft
Shelley and her parents, William and Mary
Godwin.</p>

<p>I have not intended to intimate that the Royal
Bath, with all its splendor, is anything but comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>able
and first-class. Our tall casement windows
opened directly on the sea, and the high ceilings of our
room were decorated with plaster bosses and stencilled
festoons of roses. The view at sunset over
the terrace, down the sandy beach and sweeping
over the sail-flecked waters, was at once restful and
inspiring. The crowd thronging the promenades
was in a gay, careless mood; children played in the
sand in unrestrained joy, while the many colored
lights on the pier and the lanterns of the boats gave
a touch of brilliancy to the scene. It all seemed to
strangely contrast with the spirit of the England we
were most familiar with, for Bournemouth belongs
to another day and generation than the England of
our pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The Isle of Purbeck is no island at all&mdash;even
as the &ldquo;Isles,&rdquo; Athelney and Avilion, in no wise fulfill
the geographical requirements of islands. It is
a small peninsula of Southern Dorset, and at its
very center stands one of the most remarkable of the
English castles. Thither we go, following the coast
from Bournemouth through the somber little town
of Wareham; from thence southward over heather-mottled
hills, and ere long we catch sight of the gigantic
mound upon which are the straggling fragments
of Corfe Castle. Before the castle gate stands
Corfe village, a group of plain cottages, seemingly
as ancient as the ruin overlooking them. All are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
mellowed by the touch of time; there is naught to
mar the harmony of the dull silver grays and moss
greens of the cottages, the solid old church or of
the ruins which tower in sharp outline against a pale,
blue sky.</p>

<p>The entrance to the castle court is well above
the roofs of the cottages and is severed from the village
by a deep fosse crossed by a high-arched stone
bridge. The gate is flanked by two huge round
towers, but from the inside one sees the castle proper,
perched on the summit of the mound, its very
foundation stones high above the gate towers.
Standing among the stupendous ruins we realize the
amazing strength the castle possessed, both in construction
and position. Huge fragments of walls
and towers rise above us like thunder-riven cliffs,
their bald outlines softened in places by the clinging
ivy. Here and there masses of fallen masonry are
lying about like boulders, so solidly does the mass
cling together. So ruinous are the walls that it is
difficult to identify the different apartments, and
even the antiquarians have trouble in restoring the
original plan of the castle. The keep itself, generally
intact, is shattered, one fragment, almost the
entire height of the structure, standing curiously like
a huge chimney. Clearly enough, an explosive was
the agent of destruction here&mdash;Corfe Castle was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
razed with gunpowder by express order of Cromwell&rsquo;s
Parliament.</p>

<div class="center">
<a name="bw_35" id="bw_35"></a><img src="images/bw_35.jpg" width="600" height="415" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CORFE VILLAGE AND CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>From the wall on the highest point of the
mound, one has a wide prospect. It was a clear
lucent day and when we climbed a broken tower
the whole peninsula of Purbeck spread beneath us
like a map. It is now bleak and sterile, spotted with
gorse and heather and broken in places with chalk
cliffs. Yet when the castle was built the region was
covered with a stately forest, of which no trace now
remains. Far to the north we see the Wareham
road winding away like a serpent, while a stony trail
cuts squarely across the moor to the west. When
we prepare to take our leave, we ask the custodian
concerning the road to Lulworth, and he points out
the uninviting byway through the fields. We had
planned to return to Wareham, but this route, he
assures us, is shorter and &ldquo;very good,&rdquo;&mdash;strange
ideas of good roads had the old man if he could
so describe the ten miles through the moors to Lulworth,
quite as bad as any of equal distance we
found in ten thousand miles.</p>

<p>But before we go shall we ask the story of
Corfe? The tales of the abbeys and castles are
much alike and their end nearly always the same&mdash;dismantled
by Henry, destroyed by Cromwell. Still,
Corfe is very old; its records go back to Saxon
times. How weird it is to think that in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
towers that grimly guard the entrance King Edward
the Martyr was stabbed by order of his stepmother,
Elfrida, as he paused to quaff a goblet of wine. It
happened more than a thousand years ago, and from
that time until Cromwell&rsquo;s gunpowder sent walls and
towers tottering to destruction, the sequestered castle
was the scene of intermittent turmoil and bloodshed.
Sir Christopher Hatton built the more modern portions
during the reign of Elizabeth, but Corfe
brought him only trouble. In 1633 it passed from
the possession of his descendant to Sir John Bankes,
a loyal supporter of King Charles, and while he was
active in court and field, his energetic wife held the
castle against all comers. One siege she repulsed
and the surrender in 1646 was brought about only
by treachery. Brave Lady Bankes! The story of
her gallant defense will not be forgotten while a
single fragment of the old fortress remains on its
bleak, wind-swept hill.</p>

<p>But they have told us that Lulworth and its
cove are worth seeing and we are soon away over
the moorland road. A strenuous ten miles it is,
rough, stony, steep, with numerous gates to open
and close between the fields, and in places the road
is so overgrown with grass and heather as to be
hardly discernible. But from the uplands which it
traverses one may see the ocean on the left and to
the right a long array of rolling hills and winding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
valleys, all in the purple glow of full-blown heather,
with here and there a lonely cottage or group of
trees. We begin a long descent, following the edge
of the hill toward the sea, and a sharp turn leads
down a short steep grade into Lulworth.</p>

<p>The village some years ago had merely a few
thatched cottages nestling beneath the high hills to
the landward, but of late Lulworth has assumed
airs as a trippers&rsquo; resort in the summertime, and the
red-tiled villas rather spoil its old-world effect. Lulworth
would be of no more note than other villages
scattered along the south coast were it not for its
peculiar cove, an almost circular, basinlike depression
a few hundred yards in diameter; the sea enters it
through a narrow opening in the cliffs. We were
able to take the car down to the very margin of
the water. An angular, red-whiskered fisherman approached
us and in broad South Country speech
offered to row us across the cove. We acquiesced
in deference to his story of slack times and hard
luck. The water of the cove has a depth of sixty
feet near the center and in old days offered shelter
to smugglers&rsquo; smacks. From the high cliffs on the
opposite side we had a magnificent view of the
rough coast line, a medley of gray, green and white,
stretching along the foam-flecked sea.</p>

<p>We soon regain the main road and pass Lulworth
Castle but a little way from the village&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
massive, rectangular structure with circular, crenelated
towers at each corner. It is not of great antiquity,
having been built during the reign of Elizabeth,
who is reputed to have visited it, and King
James came here to escape the plague in London.</p>

<p>Our route carries us back to Wareham, a
sleepy, shrunken town with little to suggest its strenuous
history. Indeed, one writer declares that no
town in England has undergone more calamities in
the shape of sieges and conflagrations from the early
wars with the Danes down to the capture of the
place by Cromwell&rsquo;s forces. It is pleasantly situated
on a strip of meadowland between two small rivers,
and today has about two thousand people. Its
wall, built more than a thousand years ago, may still
be traced throughout its entire course and proves
Wareham once of much greater extent than at present.</p>

<p>Wimborne Minster takes its name from the
church whose square towers with odd minaretlike
pinnacles loom over the town as we approach it
from the south. And rightly should the name of
the minster predominate, for it is the redeeming
feature of the commonplace Dorset town. But it
is quite enough&mdash;few English churches have a greater
store of curious relics. The chained library of
about two hundred and fifty huge volumes, each
held to its shelf by a heavy, rusty chain, is unique;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
but as one reads the ponderous titles of the books
he wonders that such precaution should have been
deemed necessary. Still, there were no &ldquo;six best
sellers&rdquo; in the day when this library was established,
and even heavy theological treatises in Latin and
Greek may have been in demand.</p>

<p>Not less curious is the orrery clock, five hundred
years old, which illustrates the astronomical
ideas of its time in compelling the sun to make a
circuit of the dial every day, while the moon occupies
a month. The sense of humor that mixes
itself with the solemnity of so many English churches
finds expression here in an odd, gnomelike automaton
on the western tower that goes through strange contortions
every quarter hour. One cannot but wonder
just what is in the huge chest&mdash;unopened for
centuries&mdash;hewn from a single log and fastened with
great bunglesome locks; but most likely it contains
records and documents pertaining to the church.
But all these marvels are nothing to those which
Wimborne Minster once possessed but which have
disappeared; a piece of the true cross and one of
the manger in which the Lord was born; some of
the earth from the Bethlehem stable and a few hairs
from Christ&rsquo;s head; a thigh bone of St. Agatha; a
few of St. Philip&rsquo;s teeth; a joint of St. Cecelia; the
hair shirt of St. Thomas a&rsquo; Becket and a small
phial of his blood. Verily Wimborne Minster was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
well supplied with the stock in trade of the early
church.</p>

<p>But the minster has associations of a less mythical
nature. In the chancel is the grave of Aethelred,
King of the West Saxons, brother of Alfred the
Great, who was slain in 871. A fine brass is set
in the slab over the grave, but this is doubtless of
more recent date. There are tombs of several crusaders,
though the effigies have been sadly mutilated.
But the most curious tomb is a gilded coffin set in a
niche in the wall, a little below the level of the floor.
On the coffin is the date 1693, which the occupant
at one time fixed as the date for his demise, but this
did not occur until ten years later. He expressed
a wish to be buried &ldquo;neither under the ground nor
above it; neither in the church nor out of it&rdquo; and
left an annuity of five pounds to keep his coffin
touched up yearly&mdash;all of which was faithfully carried
out, for thus did the church once lend itself to
clownish eccentricity.</p>

<p>Wimborne Minster delights in its relics, its traditions,
and its medieval customs. The verger told
us of one of the latter that is perhaps founded on
more of common sense than many of the old-time
practices, and which, with that continuity of custom
that confronts one everywhere in England, still
prevails. The vestrymen pass through the church
at times during the services and prod the sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
brethren with long black rods&mdash;not a bad idea, after
all, though one that could hardly be inaugurated
without precedent.</p>

<p>So much of our glimpse of Wimborne Minster;
it is late and we are bound for Southampton, forty
or more miles away as we propose to go. The road
to Ringwood and from thence to Lymington leads
through an open, heathlike country&mdash;stretches of
rank-growing ferns interspersed with the vivid purple
of the heather. A little beyond Ringwood we
enter New Forest, though in this section little of the
forest&mdash;as one thinks of the word now&mdash;is to be
seen. There are occasional groups of trees, but the
prevailing feature of the landscape is the fern-clad
heath. A cheerless road it is, but open, finely surfaced
and nearly level, with nothing to hinder the
mad rush of our motor.</p>

<p>At Lymington we hail a citizen and inquire
in our best French accent for the road to Beaulieu.
He studies awhile and shakes his head. Then we
seek a never-failing source of information&mdash;a garage
man&mdash;but to our astonishment he is puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boloo, Boloo; never heard of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, the old abbey? It can&rsquo;t be far from
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you mean Bewley, to be sure&mdash;eight miles
straight away; you can&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We hasten on over the moors and through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
stretch of woodland into a wooded valley, where we
come to a village more pleasing than any we have
yet seen in Dorset&mdash;a village of thatched cottages
and flower gardens fitting well into the charming
surroundings. The river, held in leash by a weir,
lies in broad, silvery reaches, fringed with willows,
and groups of pond lilies dot its surface. Beaulieu,
aside from its abbey, might be a shrine for the
motorist, for here is the estate of Lord Montague,
an enthusiast for the wind-shod steed, who has exchanged
his ancestral stables for motors, and, to cap
it all, is owner and editor of &ldquo;The Car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is not much left of the abbey. Henry
VIII., with characteristic thrift, floated the stone
down the river to build Hurst Castle. The refectory,
now restored and used as a parish church, is
the most perfect remnant of the once magnificent establishment,
whose church almost equalled the huge
dimensions of Winchester Cathedral. The late lord
did much to restore the ruins, which are now surrounded
by lawns and shrubbery. The monks of
Beaulieu had wide fame for good cheer&mdash;they kept
great vineyards and their wines were counted the
best in England. The vineyards throve long after
the Dissolution, but the last vine, several hundred
years old, disappeared about two centuries ago.
Just across the river there is a substantial, comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>able
hotel belonging to Lord Montague, which is
much frequented by fishermen.</p>

<p class="caption">AN ISLE OF WIGHT ROAD.</p>
</div>

<p>An hour&rsquo;s run over level but winding roads
brought us to the Great Western Hotel in Southampton.
It was a needless trip, after all, for the
Isle of Wight is best reached from Lymington,
whither we returned in the morning.</p>

<p>At Lymington the motor was loaded into a
tiny boat, nearly filling it from stem to stern, and
towed by the little channel steamer across the Solent
to Yarmouth. The captain, who commands a crew
of four men, invited us into the pilot house and gave
us his field glasses, entertaining us with a tale of
hard luck, long hours, small pay and still smaller appreciation
of his service on part of the railway company,
which owns the steamers. He was a typical
English salt, bluff and bronzed, with a dialect that
was refreshing to hear. We did not forget him,
either, and found him anxiously looking for us next
day when we were ready to return to the mainland.</p>

<p>Here we are on the sunniest, calmest of summer
days in the isle whose greatest charm for us is,
perhaps, in the fact that Tennyson spent most of his
active life here and did much of his best work in his
island home. But this is far from the only attraction
of the romantic island, so small that a circuit of sixty-five
miles takes one over the coast roads. The eastern
and half the northern coast is dotted with in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>creasingly
popular resort towns, of which Cowes, of
yachting fame, is the best known, and thither we
direct our course.</p>

<p>It is open day at Osborne House and the short
excursion by steamer from Southampton appeals to
English people as few other holiday trips. And it
is not strange when one reflects that no other place
was in such a strict sense the home of Queen Victoria
as Osborne House, or has so many memories
of her life. The rather ineffective Italian villa was
designed and built by herself and the Prince Consort
and here were passed the happy years of the
early married life of the royal couple. It was the
queen&rsquo;s private property and descended to King Edward,
who presented it to the nation. As it stands
now, it may be said to be a memorial to the queen.
Here are the family portraits and the marvelous
presents given to Victoria on the occasions of her
golden and diamond jubilees; some were from other
rulers, but the most wonderful came from Indian
potentates and the colonies. These defy all description.
The queen died here in 1901, and altogether
Osborne House is full of the deepest significance
to the average British subject. The crowds
that thronged the palace grounds on the day of our
visit, we were told, were quite representative of the
open days of the summer season.</p>

<p>Newport, the capital and metropolis of the is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>land,
is a modern-looking town, whose greatest interest
is Carisbrooke Castle, the stronghold of the
ancient governors. It stands on an eminence overlooking
the town and charming indeed was the prospect
that greeted us from the walls on that shimmering
summer afternoon. The town, with its red-brick,
slate-roofed buildings, lay just below us; about
it were the tiny fields, with the green meadowlands,
the ripening grain, great trees and snug cottages.
One may walk on the battlements&mdash;in part modern
replacements&mdash;entirely around the castle walls, and
thus view the ruin from every angle.</p>

<p>Carisbrooke&rsquo;s chief memory is of Charles I.,
who came here as a guest only to be detained as a
prisoner. The room he occupied has disappeared,
but the window in its outer wall, through which he
twice essayed to escape, may yet be seen. It was
during his captivity here that he first lost hope; his
hair turned gray and his trim, jaunty cavalier air
forsook him. Finally, on the last night of November,
1648, he was seized by two companies of
Roundhead horse and carried to Yarmouth and
from thence to Windsor Castle. This was the beginning
of the end. After the King&rsquo;s execution, the
Princess Elizabeth and the young duke of Gloucester
were sent here by order of Parliament. The
princess soon died and is buried in Newport Church,
where a marble effigy marks the tomb. Aside from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
the melancholy history of King Charles, the annals
of Carisbrooke have few events of importance. Its
decay and resulting ruin were due to ages of neglect.</p>

<p>Beginning at Ryde, four miles north of Newport,
we followed the coast, passing a succession of
resort towns. Ryde is situated on a hillside sloping
toward the sea, and its water front with drives and
gardens, is one of the most charming we know of.
The road from Ryde to Ventnor is crooked, narrow,
and highly dangerous in places. At times it runs
through closely bordering forests; again along the
edge of an almost precipitous incline; then it climbs
a long, terribly steep hill, but is never more than a
few hundred yards from the coast.</p>

<p>The Royal Hotel at Ventnor comes up to its
pretensions but poorly. We were surprised to find
the last three parties registered in the visitors&rsquo; book
coming from France, Germany and Sweden respectively,
while our own added a fourth foreign
registry in succession. The number of foreign
guests at this hotel seemed to indicate that Ventnor
is more popular with continental people than the average
English resort town, for as a rule we found
very few European guests. Ventnor is situated on
a precipitous hill-slope, quite sheltered from the
north and east. The houses run up the hill in terraces
and the ledge of rock along the beach is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
barely wide enough for the promenade. The climate
is mild and few spots in England are more favored
by invalids. It was this that brought poor
John Keats in 1817, and he composed &ldquo;Lamia&rdquo;
during his stay. Here was a favorite resort of Tennyson
before he settled in Freshwater, and Longfellow&rsquo;s
visit in 1868 is commemorated by an inscription
which he composed for the fountain near the
hotel in Shanklin, the old town nearly contiguous to
Ventnor. Shanklin contains many bits of the picturesque
old-time island&mdash;touches of antiquity quite
wanting in Ventnor.</p>

<p>The following day was one to be remembered;
a day as near perfection as one may have in England&mdash;the
sky pale blue, cloudless and serene, toning
to lucent gray near the horizon, and the air fresh
and invigorating. Our road closely followed the
coast with an almost continual view of the sea. The
ocean lay darkly under the rocks, rippled over
stretches of silvery beach, or glittered under the long
headlands, whose white chalk cliffs were almost
dazzling in the sunlight. There were flower-embowered
cottages along the road, but no villages for
many miles. We gave two hours to the twenty miles
to Freshwater and enjoyed the beauty to our hearts&rsquo;
content&mdash;but no! to do that one must linger until
darkness shuts out the view.</p>

<p>Freshwater became famous through its associ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>ation
with Tennyson, and the poet by coming here
destroyed to a certain extent the very retirement and
quiet that he sought, for the tourists followed him,
much to his disgust. Yet he used to go about in a
great slouching hat and military cloak that advertised
his presence to everyone&mdash;an inconsistency that even
his little grandchild is said to have noticed, and that
she queried in her childish innocence, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
like people to look at you, Grandpa, why do you
wear that queer hat and cloak?&rdquo; But in any event,
the trippers, though often snubbed for their pains,
flocked to Freshwater. They still come to the old
home of the poet, and the present Lord Tennyson
is said to welcome them even less than did his father.</p>

<p>We stopped at a post card shop just opposite
the rear entrance to Farringford&mdash;a rustic gate opening
into a narrow roadway between tall trees&mdash;and
they told us that the ban on visitors was absolute.
But one might see the house from the road. The unprecedented
snow of the preceding winter had almost
destroyed the tree so beloved of the poet&mdash;the</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&ldquo;giant Ilex, keeping leaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When frosts are keen and days are brief,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>which hid the front of the house. Besides, the owner
was now at Aldworth and the gardener might not
be so averse to visitors&mdash;but we ignore the hint and
content ourselves with a visit to Freshwater Church.
Lady Tennyson is buried in the churchyard, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
grave marked by a white marble cross. Inside there
are tablets inscribed to the poet and his wife, who
were regular attendants at the church, and a marble
statue to the memory of Lionel, the son who died on
shipboard in the Red Sea when returning from India.
The village of Freshwater is full of picturesque
cottages, and there are many more pretentious modern
villas which indicate that the blight of a popular
watering place threatens it. High on the hill, over
the town and sea, towers the Tennyson memorial,
a great Celtic cross, forty feet in height, reared by the
poet&rsquo;s admirers in England and America.</p>

</div>

<p>There is little to see at Yarmouth, where we
wait an hour or more for the boat. In the church
is buried Admiral Holmes, the man who took the
village of New Amsterdam from the Dutch and
called it New York, and a marble statue, representing
the great seaman standing by a cannon, commemorates
this and other achievements. An English
writer tells this curious story of the monument:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Even a poor judge of such things can see at
a glance that this is no ordinary piece of work. It
is said that the unfinished statue was intended to
represent Louis XIV. and was being conveyed by
the sculptor in a French ship to Paris in order that
the artist might model the head from the living subject.
Holmes captured the vessel and conceived the
brilliant idea of compelling the artist to complete the
work with his (the admiral&rsquo;s) likeness instead of
that of le Grand Monarque. The old fellow seems
to wear a grim smile as he thinks of the joke, but
as the head is undoubtedly of inferior workmanship
to the body, the artist may have felt that he had
his revenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The admiral was a native of Yarmouth and a
part of his mansion is incorporated into the Pier
Hotel. It still retains the old staircase and much
antique paneling; and a tablet on the wall recites
that Charles II. was a guest here in 1671 on a visit
to Holmes.</p>

<p>We were soon aboard the little steamer, and
despite marine rules and regulations, on the bridge
with our friend the captain. We noticed that he
was going far out of the usual course, directly toward
the wreck of the Gladiator. For the warship
Gladiator lay on her side a few furlongs off the
coast west of Yarmouth, whither she had staggered
and fallen when mortally wounded in a collision with
the American liner, St. Paul, a few months before.
Salvage crews were working to raise her and we
naturally expressed interest in the sight. Our ancient
mariner heard it and as he steered toward the
wreck muttered something about getting &ldquo;out of the
way of the current,&rdquo; but added, &ldquo;They may think
I did it to give you a good view of the Gladiator!&rdquo;&mdash;and
we are still wondering if that was the reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
for his detour. Far down the Solent he pointed
out the Needles, Swinburne&rsquo;s &ldquo;loose-linked rivets
of rock,&rdquo; and he told us of the wild storms and
shifting bars that confound the navigators in this
locality. Ere long he had to attend closely to business,
for the channel to Lymington is narrow and
tortuous, being navigable only at high tide. A
large coaling steamer partly obstructed our way and
called forth a series of marine objurgations from our
friend, but he quickly swung to the pier and the
motor soon scrambled out of her little craft up the
steep bank to terra firma.</p>

<p>We find that our jaunt in the Isle of Wight
has covered only seventy miles and occupied just
a day; still, thanks to our trusty car, we have seen
about all the points of interest that the average tourist
would care to see and which it would have required
several days to visit in the ordinary manner
of travel.</p>

SOUTH ENGLAND NOOKS</h2>

<p>One will find Lyndhurst in New Forest a
pleasant place for a day&rsquo;s rest after returning from
the Isle of Wight to the mainland. Especially is
this so if it be early in the summer before the more
crowded season comes on. The town will be fairly
quiet then and the Crown Inn has an air of solid
comfort that almost takes it out of the class of resort
hotels. Its spacious gardens to the rear afford a
sylvan retreat that is an agreeable variation from an
almost continual life on the open road. Lyndhurst,
it is true, is no longer the retired village of half a
century ago, when Leighton and Millais came here
to get away from busy London and to pursue their
sketching without interruption. The rather ugly red
brick church just over the way from the Crown evidences
Lyndhurst&rsquo;s modernity, though its distressing
newness may be momentarily forgotten in contemplation
of Leighton&rsquo;s great altar piece, illustrating
the story of the ten virgins.</p>

<p>One may care little about William Rufus, who
was so fond of hunting in New Forest and who,
while engaged in his favorite pastime, was killed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
a forester&rsquo;s arrow; yet a pilgrimage to the spot
where he is said to have fallen is worth while&mdash;not
merely to see the iron casting which encases the old
stone, but to view one of the prettiest glades in the
forest. We came early in the day, which is the time
to come to avoid the crowds of trippers who flock
here in season, and we had undivided possession of
the scene of sylvan beauty. A shaded byway leads
to the main road, which soon brings us to Romsey.</p>

<p>There is little to detain the wayfarer in Romsey
aside from the abbey church, whose high roof
reaches almost to the top of its central tower&mdash;in
fact, the noble bulk of the church rises over the
town, completely dwarfing the low buildings that
crowd closely around it. One can but admire its
great size and perfect proportions, and though there
may be incongruous details, these will hardly be
noticed by the layman.</p>

<p>The interior is almost pure Norman&mdash;massive
pillars supporting the great rounded arches. The
height and size of the columns give the church an
impressiveness that is hardly surpassed by any other
in the Kingdom, and after Durham, it easily ranks
as the finest example of Norman architecture extant.
It dates mainly from the twelfth century, and
a Saxon church previously occupied the site, slight
remains of this being incorporated into the present
building. The most remarkable Saxon relic is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
life-size image of Christ upon the cross, of a type
not found later than the eleventh century.</p>

<p>There is often a gruesome side to the old English
church&mdash;a bit of human skin flayed from a living
church robber is shown at Gloucester, frightful effigies
representing decayed corpses at Canterbury
and Sherborne, and at Romsey a broad plait of
human hair, found in recent restoration work. It
was in a leaden casket and even the bones had
mouldered to dust, but the soft brown hair was almost
unaltered, and it is thought to have adorned
the head of some Roman maiden, for the casket
showed traces of Roman work. The old caretaker
has reserved this weird little relic for the last of his
wonders&mdash;we leave the abbey and pass out into
the sunshine of the perfect summer day. We shall
not soon forget Romsey Abbey Church and we
cast more than one backward glance as its giant
bulk recedes in the distance.</p>

</div>

<p>Surely Twyford, a few miles south of Winchester,
has quite outlived any claim to its one-time
title of &ldquo;Queen of Hampshire villages.&rdquo; It has paid
the price of its popularity; modern brick buildings
crowd upon its creeper-clad cottages or have superseded
them altogether. Its church has been restored
to the point of newness, and its yew tree, locally
reputed to be the largest in England, is easily surpassed
by the one at Selborne. Still, Twyford is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
not without an especial interest to American visitors.
Here stands the Elizabethan mansion where Benjamin
Franklin penned his autobiography while a
guest of the vicar of St. Asaphs. The rambling old
house with a fine stretch of lawn in front of it may
be plainly seen from the road.</p>

<p>No matter how frequently the wanderer may
pause in Winchester, the attraction of the ancient
capital can never be outworn. One might spend a
day among the college buildings, whose rough flint
walls and slate roofs, sagging but little beneath the
weight of years, stand much the same as when the
builder finished them six hundred years ago. Nor
should St. Cross and its quaint brotherhood, one
of those strange medieval charities, be forgotten. A
great quadrangle of buildings and an elaborate
church, all for &ldquo;thirteen poor men decayed and past
their strength,&rdquo; seems a great means for a small
achievement. Much has fallen into disuse, but the
church is still in good condition and in many respects
a remarkable piece of architecture. But after all,
Winchester&rsquo;s greatest charm is not in her college or
her cathedral, but in her old-world streets and odd
corners. Nor should one forget the shops in which
antiques of merit in furniture, books and other articles
may be found.</p>

<p>A broad easy road leads from Winchester
through Alton to Jane Austen&rsquo;s Chawton, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
whence a secluded byway brings us to Selborne, a
nook that every tourist knows. But Selborne, nestling
beneath its hills, its thatched cottages and weather-worn
buildings stretching along a wide grass-grown
street, has no hint of the resort town. There
are other villages in the Hampshire and Surrey hills
that may match it, but none of them had a Gilbert
White to give it immortality.</p>

<p>The street was quite deserted on the drowsy
summer afternoon when we checked our car under
the great tree beneath which the village worthys congregate
in Selborne. A shopkeeper pointed out
the Wakes, once White&rsquo;s vicarage, which a modern
owner has extended into a large rambling house,
probably bearing little resemblance to the modest
home of the curate of Selborne. Still, it incorporates
his cottage, though red brick and tile have displaced
the half-timber gables and thatched roof.
But his church is not much altered and the giant
yew, the largest we saw in England, is still standing,
hale and green. Its circumference measured twenty-three
feet in White&rsquo;s time, and he declared that its
years must be at least coeval with Christianity. Its
girth at present exceeds twenty-five feet. One cannot
stand beneath it without being impressed with its
hoary antiquity, and the great events that crowd
the procession of years which have passed over the
old tree quite overwhelm one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, it must have stood here when the
Romans ruled in Britain; it was sturdy and green
when the Conqueror came a thousand summers
past, and it looks today as if it well might weather
the storms of a third millennium. Such historic trees
have almost a human personality; and, fortunately,
they are carefully guarded by an enlightened public
sentiment in England.</p>

<p>The day is a quiet one in Selborne; we have
the yew tree and church all to ourselves. We wander
about the churchyard and with difficulty locate
the unpretentious headstone with the almost illegible
initials, &ldquo;G. W.&rdquo;&mdash;a simple memorial, indeed&mdash;though
inside the church there is an appropriate
tablet to the memory of the well beloved
naturalist. One can easily see how he could lead
in Selborne the simple studious life reflected in his
works. Verily, we need a revival of his plain common
sense today when the fiction of the nature-faker
bids fair to supersede the facts of natural history.</p>

<p>From Selborne it is but a step across the border
into the downs of Sussex&mdash;&ldquo;Green Sussex, fading
into blue,&rdquo; as the poet so aptly puts it. The low
sun strikes along the rough hills as we enter Midhurst,
nestling in a nook in the downs and reached
by rather difficult roads. It is a quiet town with
an air of thorough self-contentment; a town of
weather-beaten houses with over-hanging timbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
gables, sagging tile roofs and diamond-paned casements;
one long wide street sweeps through it with
narrow crooked lanes branching to either side&mdash;an
unspoiled old-country town, as yet quite undiscovered
by the globe-trotters.</p>

<p>And yet Midhurst is not without historic importance,
having been a place of considerable size
at the time of the Conquest. The site of its strong
castle which once stood on the banks of the pretty
little river, Rother, is now marked only by a grass-covered
mound; but it was once the home of a
powerful Norman family, the Bohuns, who in 1547
entertained King Edward VI. in great splendor.
Nor is Midhurst wanting in associations with famous
men, for Sir Charles Lyell, the great geologist,
and Richard Cobden, the &ldquo;Father of English Free
Trade,&rdquo; received their early education in the ancient
grammar school which may yet be seen.</p>

<p>But the romance of Midhurst is in Cowdray
Park, the estate which adjoins the town. What a
pity it is that the mansion and the story did not
seize the fancy of Walter Scott&mdash;who alone could
have done it justice. We entered the park and
drove through an avenue of giant chestnuts directly
to the shattered palace. And what a glorious ruin
it is, with its immense stone-mullioned windows, its
great grouped chimneys, and sculptured mantels and
bosses that cling to the wall here and there. Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
roofless, the walls are almost entire, and over them
the ivy flings its dark mantle and falls in heavy
masses from the broken battlements. One does not
care to analyze the ruin into its component parts&mdash;what
did we care for hall and chapel and chamber?
It is the impression that came to us as we wandered
through it in the fading light that lingers with us
now. What a memory it is of darkened halls, of
great empty windows, through which the light falls
mellow and ghostly, and of weird traditions which
the old crone who keeps the key constantly droned
in our ears.</p>

<p class="caption">COWDRAY CASTLE, NEAR MIDHURST.</p>
</div>

<p>The curse of Cowdray has made more than
one listener shudder and turn pale and even those
who listen as we do in benevolent scepticism can
only say, &ldquo;Strange&mdash;strange!&rdquo; For the lands of
Cowdray were rent from the monkish owners by the
ruthless Henry and were given into the possession
of the first viscount of Montague, who built the
splendid palace, one of the costliest and most imposing
in the Kingdom. It was in no sense a fortified
castle, but a great baronial residence, standing
on low-lying grounds with no attempt at strength of
position. In some respects the palace recalls Kirby
Hall, though here ruin is more complete.</p>

<p>When the last monkish habitant departed
from the lands of Cowdray, he left his curse upon
them: that the line of the Montagues should per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>ish
by fire and water. It was long in being fulfilled,
but in 1793 the palace was destroyed by fire
and the last Montague was drowned in a foolhardy
attempt to swim across the Rhine above the Falls
of Schoffhausen. He must have perished without
knowing the fate of his ancestral home. With the
palace were burned many works of art and antiquities
of inestimable value, among the latter the
roll of Battle Abbey and the coronation robes and
sword of William the Conqueror. The estate descended
to the sister of Lord Montague, who, dreading
the curse, is said to have guarded her two sons
with the greatest care, even filling the fish ponds near
her home and keeping the youths jealously away
from sea and river. Yet one day they escaped from
the care of their attendants and were both drowned
in the sea at Bognor. The broken-hearted mother
sold Cowdray to the Earl of Egremont, who had
no issue to inherit it. But the curse seems to cling
to it still&mdash;after our visit a wealthy London contractor
purchased the estate and began a thorough
repair of the modern house (not the ruined palace),
but while the work was in progress the mansion
caught fire and was burned to the ground.</p>

<p>Darkness overtakes us as we sweep along the
hills toward Worthing, where we arrive by lamplight.
Morning reveals a quiet and somewhat secluded
watering-town, patronized by people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
seek to get away from the ceremony and expense
of such places as Brighton and Bournemouth. Its
hotels are unpretentious, comfortable and accommodating&mdash;qualities
not so common to resort inns as
to go without notice. But Worthing is modern;
there is little to detain one on such a pilgrimage as
our own. We follow the broad white road which
climbs steadily northward from the sea to the distant
hills and winds among them to the dreary hamlet
of Washington. The name, so familiar to us,
bears no reference to the distinguished family. It
is of old Saxon derivation&mdash;Wasa-inga-tun (town
of the sons of Wasa).</p>

</div>

<p>Near at hand is Warminghurst, once the Sussex
home of William Penn, who bought the great
house in 1676. One of his children died here and is
buried in Coolham churchyard close by. Penn was
wont to attend services at the meeting house not far
away, which was built of timbers taken from one of
his ships. It goes locally by the strange designation
of &ldquo;The Blue Idol&rdquo;&mdash;just why, no one seemed to
know&mdash;and we wandered long in unmarked byroads
ere we found it. It is a mile and a half from
Coolham, and one follows for a mile a narrow lane
branching from the Billingshurst road.</p>

<p>The simple old caretaker lives in a modern addition
to the chapel and tills the plot of ground in
connection with it. The chapel is a low brick-and-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>timber
building whose interior is the plainest imaginable;
a half dozen high-backed benches, a
platform pulpit without a stand, and a few books
made up its furnishings. As at Jordans, the women
sat during worship in a gallery which could be cut
off by a sliding partition in case of interruption by
persecutors. The old law forbade the assembling
of women in the Quaker meetings, but from the
gallery they could participate in the services, yet
could instantly be shut out of the room if the king&rsquo;s
officers should arrive. Outside, the chapel is surrounded
by greensward and tall trees, and the old
man was mowing the grass in the tiny burying-ground.
Services are still held at intervals, as they
have been for the past two centuries or more. Probably
the spot was chosen on account of its very
retirement, since when the chapel was built it was
a criminal offense for the Quakers to assemble in
any place of worship. The chapel is unaltered and
seems quite as remote and lonely as it must have
been in Penn&rsquo;s time; and the spirit of that old day
comes very near as one stands in the tiny room where
the founder of the great American Commonwealth
was wont to worship according to his conscience,
coming hither from Warminghurst in his heavy ox-wagon.</p>

<p class="caption">THE &ldquo;BLUE IDOL,&rdquo; PENN&rsquo;S MEETING HOUSE, SUSSEX.</p>
</div>

<p>We now begin an uninterrupted run to the
east through Mid-Sussex over an unsurpassed road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
to Cuckfield, Hayward&rsquo;s Heath, and Uckfield. We
continue on the London and Eastbourne road to
Hailsham, from whence a digression of three or four
miles brings us to the ruins of Herstmonceux Castle.
Though styled a castle, it was really a great castellated
country mansion, never intended as a defensive
fortress. It reminds one in a certain way of Cowdray,
though it lacks much of the beauty and grace
of the Midhurst palace, and its conversion by its
owner into a picnic ground also does much to detract.</p>

<p>The story of its destruction is peculiar. It was
deliberately dismantled and partially torn down in
1777 by its owner, who used the materials in erecting
a smaller house, now called Herstmonceux Place,
which would be less expensive to maintain. It is interesting
to know that Wyatt, the architect who
dealt so barbarously with Salisbury and Hereford
Cathedrals, was the advisor of this wanton destruction.
The last descendant of the original owner died
in 1662, and since then the estate has changed hands
many times. It is now one of the most popular tripper
resorts in Sussex and during the summer months
the daily visitors number hundreds.</p>

<p>It is not our wont to trouble ourselves much
with the sober history of such places, but there is
one melancholy incident of the early days of the
palace which has weird interest for the wanderer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
who stands amidst the shattered grandeur, and which
we may best relate in the words of an English historian:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Dacre, of Herstmonceux, a young nobleman
of high spirit and promise, not more than twenty-four
years old, was tempted by his own folly, or
that of his friends, to join a party to kill deer in the
park of an unpopular neighbor. The excitement
of lawless adventure was probably the chief or only
inducement for the expedition; but the party were
seen by the foresters; a fray ensued, in which one of
the latter was mortally wounded and died two days
after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had Lord Dacre been an ordinary offender
he would have been disposed of summarily. Both
he and his friends happened to be general favorites.
The Privy Council hesitated long before they resolved
on a prosecution and at last it is likely they
were assisted by a resolution from the King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I found all the Lords at the Star Chamber,&rsquo;
Sir William Paget wrote to Wriothesley, &lsquo;assembled
for a conference touching Lord Dacre&rsquo;s case. They
had with them present the Chief Justice with others
of the King&rsquo;s learned council, and albeit I was
excluded, yet they spoke so loud, some of them,
that I might hear them notwithstanding two doors
shut between us. Among the rest that could not
agree to wilful murder, the Lord Cobham, as I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
him by his voice, was very vehement and stiff.&rsquo;
They adjourned at last to the King&rsquo;s Bench. The
Lord Chancellor was appointed High Steward and
the prisoner was brought up to the bar. He pleaded
&lsquo;not guilty,&rsquo; he said that he intended no harm, he
was very sorry for the death of the forester, but it
had been caused in an accidental struggle; and
&lsquo;surely,&rsquo; said Paget, who was president, &lsquo;it was a
pitiful sight to see a young man brought by his own
folly into so miserable a state.&rsquo; The lords, therefore,
as it seems they had determined among themselves,
persuaded him to withdraw his plea and submit to
the King&rsquo;s clemency. He consented; and they repaired
immediately to the Court to intercede for his
pardon. Eight persons in all were implicated&mdash;Lord
Dacre and seven companions. The young
nobleman was the chief object of commiseration;
but the King remained true to his principles of equal
justice; the frequency of crimes of violence had required
extraordinary measures of repression; and if
a poor man was to be sent to the gallows for an act
into which he might be tempted by poverty, thoughtlessness
could not be admitted as an adequate excuse
because the offender was a peer. Four out of
the eight were pardoned. For Lord Dacre there
was to the last an uncertainty. He was brought to
the scaffold, when an order arrived to stay the execution,
probably to give time for a last appeal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Henry. But if it was so the King was inexorable.
Five hours later the sheriff was again directed to
do his duty; and the full penalty was paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving the ruined mansion we drop down to
the seashore, passing Bexhill on the way to Hastings,
which is now a modern city of sixty-five thousand
people, its red-brick, tile-roofed houses rising in terraces
overlooking the sea. Once it was an important
seaport, but here the sea has advanced and wiped
out the harbor, and it is now chiefly known as a
watering-place. A few miles from the town was
fought the Battle of Hastings, which stamped the
name so deeply on English history and marked the
overthrow of the Saxon dynasty. On a precipitous
hill looking far over town and sea stands the
scanty ruin of its castle, whose story is much clouded,
though legend declares it was built by the Conqueror.</p>

<p>Far greater is the attraction of the unspoiled
old towns of Winchelsea and Rye, a few miles
farther on the coast road. A former visit gives them
a familiar look, but we stop an hour in Rye. The
receding sea robbed these towns of their importance
hundreds of years ago, and their daily life is now
quite undisturbed by modern progress. Each occupies
a commanding hill separated by a few miles
of low-lying land. A local writer makes the truest
appeal for Rye when he declares that it gives us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
today a presentment of a town of centuries earlier.
&ldquo;Rye,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is southern and opulent in coloring.
There is here mellowness, a gracious beauty; one
has the feeling that every house and garden is the
pride and love of its owner, and indeed this impression
is a true one, for it is the characteristic of Rye
to inspire the loving admiration of its inhabitants,
whether native-born or drawn thither in later life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rye has a magnificent church, the largest in
Sussex, which overshadows the town from the very
crest of the hill. A very unusual church it is, with
a low cone-pointed tower and triple roofs lying alongside
each other. At the end of the nave are three
immense stone-mullioned windows, very effective and
imposing, though the glass is modern. Queen Elizabeth
presented to the church the remarkable old
tower clock which has marked time steadily for more
than three hundred years. The pendulum swings
low inside, describing a wide arc only a little above
the preacher&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p class="caption">THE HOSPITAL, RYE.<br />
From Original Water Color by Theresa Thorp, A. R. M. S.</p>
</div>

<p>Rye itself is quite as interesting as its church,
a place of crooked lanes and odd buildings, among
which the hospital pictured in such a realistic manner
by our artist is one of the most notable. It is
a splendid combination of stucco and timber, with
red tiled gables and diamond-paned lattice windows.
Much else there is in Rye to tempt one to linger,
but the sun is setting and we are off on the fine level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
road to Folkestone. For the latter half of the distance
we run along the very edge of the ocean&mdash;as
we saw it, fifteen miles of shimmering twilight
water. Those who are attracted by the gruesome
will pause at the old church in Hythe to see the
strange collection of human remains, thousands of
skulls and bones, that are ranged on shelves or piled
in heaps on the floor in the crypt. Whence these
ghastly relics came, antiquarians dispute; but local
tradition has it that a great battle was fought near
Hythe, between the Britons and Danes, and these
bones are the remains of the slain. Be that as it may,
one does not care to linger&mdash;a mere glance at such
a charnel house is quite sufficient.</p>

<p>Folkestone may well contest with Brighton,
Bournemouth and Portsmouth for first honors among
English watering-places. We have seen nearly all
of them and we should be inclined, in some particulars,
to give the honors to Folkestone; but let those
who enjoy such places be the judges. Anyway,
there are few statelier hotels in England than those
on the east cliff and few that occupy a more magnificent
site. At the Grand they are more willing
to permit you to take ease than at most English
hotels of its class. You are not required under penalty
to be on hand for dinner at a certain hour, announced
usually by a strident gong, and to make the
pretense of swallowing an almost uneatable table d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>&rsquo;hote
concoction pushed along by a vigilant waiter
bent on making all possible speed. This hotel and
many others stand on the east cliff several hundred
feet above the sea, but one may reach the shore by
a lift, or if inclined to exercise, by a steep winding
pathway. On moderately clear days, the white line
of the French coast may be seen from the hotel.</p>

<p>Very like to Folkstone is Dover, but seven miles
farther up the coast, and thither we proceed over a
steep road closely following the sea. Dover was
chief of the cinque ports of olden days and its small
bay still affords shelter for shipping, including ocean-going
steamers. But the first thing that catches the
pilgrim&rsquo;s eye when he comes into Dover is the splendidly
preserved, or rather restored, castle, which
stands in sullen inaccessibility on the clifflike hill
overlooking the city. We make the stiff climb up
to the castle gateway, only to be halted by the
guard with the information that we are an hour early.
We have had such experiences before and we suggest
that no possible harm can be done by admitting
us at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really cawn&rsquo;t do it, sir,&rdquo; said the guard.
&ldquo;Some of the guards got careless in letting people
in before hours and the Colonel says he will court-martial
the next one who does it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course this silences our importunity and we
engage our soldier friend in conversation. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
did he enter the army?&mdash;Because a common man has
no chance in England; he was going to the dogs and
the army seemed the best opportunity open to him.
He had enlisted three years ago and it had made a
man of him, to use his own words. He rather looked
it, too&mdash;a husky young fellow with a fairly good face.</p>

<p>The castle is strongly fortified and garrisoned
by a regiment of soldiers. The interior of the court
is largely occupied by barrack buildings, and of the
ancient castle the keep is the most important portion
left. It was built to withstand the ages, for its walls
are twenty-three feet in thickness and it rises to a
height of nearly one hundred feet. Within it is a
well three hundred feet deep, supposed to have been
sunk by the Saxon king, Harold. The primitive
chapel dates from Norman times. There are also
remains of the foundation of the lighthouse that occupied
the commanding height, long</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Dover has other antiquities, among them a
church so old that its origin has been quite forgotten.
Roman brick was used in its construction, probably
by Saxon builders. Over against the town gleams
the white chalk of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Cliff, so called because
of the reference in King Lear. Queen Eliz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>abeth
visited Dover and vented her wit for rhyming
on its mayor, who, standing on a stool, began,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The eastern Kentish coast, lying nearest to the
continent, once had many towns of importance that
have since dwindled and decayed. Among these
is Sandwich, once second of the cinque ports; but
the coast line receded until it is now two miles away.
The town contains some of the richest bits of medieval
architecture in England. The wall which once
surrounded it may still be traced and one of the
original gateways is intact. We drove through the
narrow crooked lanes that serve as streets in Sandwich,
and could scarce believe the population no
more than three thousand. The low lichen-covered
buildings, with leaning walls and sagging, dull-red
tiles, straggle over enough space for a city of three
or four times the size. There is no touch of newness
anywhere; no note of inharmonious color jars
with the silver grays, grayish greens and brownish
reds that prevail on every hand; no black and white
paint destroys the beauty of the brick and timber
fronts and gables. Most of the houses have but one
story and the streets run with delightful disregard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
of straight lines and bid defiance to points of the
compass. The two churches with splendid open-beamed
oak roofs are well in keeping with the spirit
of the surrounding twelfth and thirteenth century
structures. They stand a mute evidence of the one-time
greatness and prosperity of Sandwich. One of
the old houses is pointed out as the stopping-place
of Queen Elizabeth when she was touring the
Kentish coast.</p>

<p>From Sandwich we skim along smooth, level
roads to Ramsgate, Broadstairs and Margate, the
last of the long chain of resort towns of the southeastern
coast stretching from Land&rsquo;s End to the
Thames River. What an array of them there is:
Penzance, Torquay, Portsmouth, Bournemouth,
Brighton, Eastbourne, Bexhill, Hastings, Folkestone,
Dover, Ramsgate, Broadstairs, Margate, and
a host of lesser lights. We have seen them nearly
all and many more such places on the northern and
western coasts, as well as a number of inland resorts.
It is therefore a phase of England with which we
have become fairly familiar, and the old towns and
isolated ruins seem only the more charming and time-mellowed
by contrast with the crowded and sometimes
gaudy modern resorts. Margate, situated just
at the mouth of the Thames on low-lying grounds,
is one of the most pretentious of all.</p>

<p>A few miles out of Margate we turn from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
main Canterbury road into a byway from which we
enter the lanes through the fields and farmyards.
The country is level and intersected everywhere by
sluggish drains; but the wheatfields, nearly ready
for the harvest, are as fine as we have seen in England.
From afar we catch sight of the twin towers
of the ruined church at Reculver, the object of our
meanderings in the fen-land lanes. We halt in the
tiny hamlet beneath the shadow of the grim sentinels
on the sea-washed headland. The old caretaker
hastens to meet us and is eager to relate the story of
the ruin. Aside from the towers there is nothing but
fragments of the walls; he points out clearly where
portions of a Roman temple were incorporated into
the Saxon church, and also the Saxon work that the
Normans used. One hundred years ago, this remarkable
church was nearly intact; but the rapid
encroachment of the sea upon the brittle rock on
which the structure stands convinced a short-sighted
vicar that it would soon be undermined by the
waves. It was therefore torn down, with the exception
of the towers, and the stone used for a
small church farther inland. The sea is now held
in check by stone and timber riprap and though it
gnaws at the very foot of the ruin, there seems little
chance that it will farther advance. Besides the
church there are the remains of a great Roman
castrum, or fort, at Reculver: a strong wall, several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
feet high in places, once enclosed a space of considerable
extent, though a large part has been inundated
by the sea.</p>

<p>One will never weary of Canterbury; come as
often as he may he will always feel a thrill of pleasure
as the great cathedral towers break on his vision.
And indeed there is nothing of the kind in all
Britain finer than these same towers. We reach
the town later than we planned and hasten to the
cathedral, but the guide, wearied with troops of
holiday visitors during the day, tells us we are too
late. We find means, however, to extend our time
and to enlist his willing services; and thus we come
to see every detail of the magnificent church as we
could hardly have done earlier in the day. It has
no place in this chronicle, this</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&ldquo;mother minster vast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That guards Augustine&rsquo;s rugged throne,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>about which volumes have been written and with
whose history and traditions the guide-books fairly
teem. We have visited it before during a Sunday-morning
service, but its vast dim aisles, its great
crypts, its storied shrines and tombs, and the ivy-clad
ruin of its old monastery, all make a strangely different
impression when viewed in the deepening
shadows of the departing day.</p>

<p>After sunset we wander about the old streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
where even the more modern buildings conform to
the all-pervading air of antiquity. It is the close of
the Saturday holiday and the main street is packed
with a cheerful crowd of people of all degrees.
Shop-keepers improve the opportunity to sell their
wares and a lively trade is carried on at the open
booths along the walks. One butcher is especially
active in booming business, having a fellow in front
of his place, a &ldquo;barker,&rdquo; we would style him in the
States, who bellows in a voice like a foghorn,
&ldquo;Lovely meat! the same that the king and nobility
heats&mdash;lovely meat.&rdquo; Surely a recommendation
that would shake the resolution of a confirmed vegetarian.</p>

<p>But we soon weary of the glare and noise of the
crowded street. We wander into the crooked
lanes that lead to the nooks and corners about the
cathedral. We catch the towers from different viewpoints;
as they stand, boldly outlined against an
opalescent sky flecked with red-toned clouds, they
form a fit study for the artist&mdash;and one of which the
artist has often availed himself. The college court
is full of shadows; how easy it would be to imagine
a cowled figure stealing along in the dusk and passing
from sight in the Norman entrance yonder&mdash;than
which there is no choicer bit of medieval architecture
in the Kingdom.</p>

<p>We have the whole of the following day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
reach London; and what a superb day it is, the
very essence of the beauty of English midsummer!
We have been over the Rochester and Maidstone
road before, so we take the narrow and hilly but
marvelously picturesque highway that drops some
fourteen miles straight southward. The country
through which it passes is distinctly rural, with here
and there a grove or a farmhouse. A little to one
side is Petham, a quiet hamlet under gigantic trees,
with a half-timbered inn seemingly out of all proportion
to the possible needs of the place. The
main road running from Hythe, near the coast,
through Ashford to Tunbridge Wells, a distance of
about fifty miles, is one of the finest in the Kingdom.
It runs in broad, sweeping curves through a gently
undulating country, and the grades are seldom
enough to check the motor&rsquo;s flight. It had lately
been re-surfaced and much of the way oiled or asphalted,
quite eliminating dust. We pass much
charming country, wooded hills, stretches of meadowland,
fields of yellowing grains, and many sleepy villages,
all shimmering in the lucent air of a perfect
summer day. The sky is as blue as one ever sees
it in England, and a few silvery-white clouds drift
lazily across it. It is what the natives call a very
warm day, but it seems only balmy to us.</p>

<p class="caption">ON THE DOWNS.<br />
From Original Painting by Alfred Elias.</p>
</div>

<p>Bethesden, Biddenden and Lamberhurst all
attract our attention. The second has a very quaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
old inn on the market square, with a queer little ivy-covered
tower; but Lamberhurst hardly merits the
extravagant praise given it by William Cobbett in
his &ldquo;Rural Rides&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;one of the most beautiful
villages that man ever set eyes upon.&rdquo; Still, it may
have altered somewhat since his time; there are few
red-brick villas among the older cottages. It is, none
the less, a pleasant place, rich with verdure and
bright with flowers, and picturesquely situated on
a gently rising hill. Coming on this road, one gets
the best conception of the really magnificent situation
of Tunbridge Wells, and cannot wonder that
it has gained such popularity. The main part of
the town lies in a depression in the undulating downs,
its villas, houses and streets all set down on a liberal
scale with plenty of room for trees, in whose luxuriant
foliage the place is half hidden. All around
stretches the wavelike succession of the hills, diversified
with forest and bright with heather and gorse.
Thackeray was very fond of Tunbridge Wells and
his enthusiastic words in &ldquo;Round About Papers&rdquo;
breathe much of the spirit of the place:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I stroll over the common and survey the beautiful
purple hills around, twinkling with a thousand
bright villas which have sprung up over this charming
ground since first I saw it. What an admirable
scene of peace and plenty! What a delicious air
breathes over the heath, blows the cloud-shadows
across it, and murmurs through the full-clad trees!
Can the world show a land fairer, richer, more
cheerful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We pause at the excellent though rather unpretentious
Grand Hotel for our late luncheon; and as
a final adieu to the pleasant town, drive through
its commons with their strange wind-worn stones,
before setting out Londonward. We pass on into
Sussex as far as Grinstead and there strike the direct
London road through Epsom, where we have a
glimpse of the famous racing downs. The quiet,
staid-looking old town gives no hint of the furor
that possesses it on Derby days. A few miles
farther we enter the outskirts of London.</p>

FROM DUBLIN TO CORK</h2>

<p>We are off for the Emerald Isle. There was
much of interest in the three days between London
and Dublin, but I will not follow our journey here;
in a later chapter I will endeavor to gather some of
the scattered threads. We reach Ludlow the first
night, one hundred and forty-eight miles in six hours&mdash;very
speedy going for us&mdash;but a day from Ludlow
to Barmouth and another to Holyhead is more
in keeping with our usual leisurely progress.</p>

<p>One can never truly feel the plaintive sweetness
of Lady Dufferin&rsquo;s song until with his own eyes he
beholds the melancholy beauty of the &ldquo;Sweet Bay
of Dublin.&rdquo; We enter its gates in the opalescent
light of a perfect morning. The purple mists hanging
over the headlands are glowing with the first
rays of the sun and the pale emerald waters flash into
burnished gold as the low beams strike along their
surface.</p>

<p>The voyage has been an easy one; our tickets
were purchased, our cabin reserved, and provision
made for the transport of the motor, all in a few
minutes at the office of the Royal Automobile Club<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
in London, and the genial touring-secretary, Mr.
Maroney, has supplied us with necessary maps and
information. We have not long to wait at the pier;
a swinging crane picks up the car from the boat
and carefully deposits it on the pavement. A railway
employee is at hand with a supply of petrol and
we are soon ready for the road. The night voyage
has been a comfortable one; we were able to go
aboard at nine o&rsquo;clock and take possession of our
cabin, quite as large and well-appointed as those of
the best ocean-going steamers, and breakfast was
served on the ship. Altogether, nothing is easier
than a trip to Ireland with a motor car if one only
goes about it rightly.</p>

<p>An unknown land lies before us. Much has
been written of Ireland&mdash;books of travel, history,
and fiction&mdash;and poets have sung her beauties and
sorrows; we have read much of the Island, but nothing
that has given us more than a hint of what we
are about to see. To know Ireland, one must take
a pilgrim&rsquo;s staff, as it were; he must study her ruins
and ancient monuments, see her cities and her towns,
her half-deserted villages, her wretched hovels and
her lonely places, and above all, must meet and know
her people; then, after all, he can only say to others,
&ldquo;If you wish to know the reality, go and do likewise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dublin is a handsomely built modern city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
three hundred thousand inhabitants and has an air
of general prosperity. It has much of interest, but
it does not rightly belong in this chronicle. The low
hum of our motor calls us to the open road, the
green fields, and the unfrequented villages. We
are soon away on the Carlow road with Cork as
our objective.</p>

<p>The road out of Dublin is distressingly rough
as compared with English highways, though it improves
before we reach Naas. Our first impressions
are distinctly melancholy; a &ldquo;deserted village&rdquo;&mdash;a
row of stone cottages, roofless, windowless, and with
crumbling or fallen walls&mdash;speaks of Ireland&rsquo;s sorrows
more plainly than any words. And such sad
reminders are not uncommon; wholly or partly
ruined villages greet us every little while on the way.</p>

<p>Naas, the first town of any size, is dirty and
unattractive, but its historic importance ill accords
with its present meanness. Its traditions are not
antedated by any town in the Island; it was once
the capital of the Leinster kings&mdash;half-clad savages,
no doubt, but kings none the less. Cromwell thought
it important enough to visit, and incidentally wiped
its strong castle out of existence. Rory O&rsquo;More a
century later burned it to the ground, destroying
some eight hundred houses&mdash;it has not so many now.
Adjoining the town is the ruin of Jigginstown House,
an unfinished palace begun on a vast scale by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Earl of Strafford, who expected to entertain Charles
I. here; but Charles failed to arrive and the Earl had
other matters&mdash;among them the loss of his head&mdash;to
engage his attention.</p>

<p>The road to the south of Naas lies in broad,
straight stretches and the surface is better, but we
found it almost deserted. This impressed us not a
little. We ran many miles, meeting no one; there
were few houses&mdash;only wide reaches of meadowland
with but few trees&mdash;and altogether the country
seemed quite uninhabited.</p>

<p>Carlow, scarce thirty miles from Naas, is rather
above the average, though it has the bare appearance
characteristic of the Irish town. We had been rather
dreading the country-town hotels and here we had
our first experience. The Club House&mdash;why so
called we did not learn&mdash;is a building not unsightly
inside, but on entering it is with difficulty we could
find anyone to minister to our wants. Finally an
untidy old man with bushy whiskers appeared and
officiated as porter, chambermaid, and waiter. He
was slow in performing his duties, but the luncheon
was better than we had hoped for. He took our
money when we left, but whether he was boots or
proprietor, we never learned.</p>

<p>Cromwell and Rory O&rsquo;More paid their compliments
to Carlow in the same emphatic manner
as at Naas. There remains but little of the castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
excepting the huge round towers that flanked the
entrance. Just out of the town is the largest of
Ireland&rsquo;s cromlechs, a mighty rock weighing one
hundred tons, supported on massive upright granite
blocks.</p>

<p>Kilkenny is twenty miles farther south. Its
castle, the home of the Duke of Ormonde, is perhaps
the most notable private residence in Ireland. It is
of ancient origin, but its present state is due to modern
restoration; no longer is it a fortress, but a castellated
mansion of great extent. It is situated on rising
ground lying directly on the river. The front facade,
flanked by two great circular towers, heavily mantled
with ivy, presents a highly-imposing appearance.
The most notable feature of the interior is the art
gallery, which is declared to be one of the most
important in the Kingdom.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">KILKENNY CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Kilkenny Cathedral is of great antiquity, having
been begun early in the eleventh century. Close
to it stands one of the round towers so characteristic
of early Irish architecture. The town has a population
of about ten thousand, and though apparently
prosperous, there was everywhere evident the untidiness
that was more or less typical of the southern
Irish towns.</p>

<p>Clonmel, however, easily ranked first in neatness
and general up-to-date appearance among the
towns we passed on our run to Cork. Here we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
came late in the evening, for we had missed our
road and gone some miles out of the way. After
leaving the vicinity of Dublin, signboards were not
to be seen and it was easy to go astray. Houses
were not frequent and often the natives could hardly
give directions to the nearest town. Before we knew
it we were entering Carrick-on-Suir, which we took
for Clonmel. Something aroused our suspicions and
we hailed a red-faced priest driving in a cart. The
good father was much befuddled and his honest
efforts afforded us little enlightenment, but we finally
learned to our chagrin that Clonmel was about
twenty miles to the west.</p>

<p>Night was falling rapidly and the car leaped
onward over a narrow, grass-grown byroad, passing
here and there a farm cottage from which the inmates
rushed in open-mouthed surprise. We soon
came into the main road and reached the town just
at dark. The hotel proved quite comfortable, though
distinctly Irish in many particulars; but perhaps our
judgment as to what constitutes comfort in an inn
was somewhat modified by the day&rsquo;s experiences;
we were hardly so critical as we should have been
across the channel.</p>

<p>We had come to Clonmel solely to pass the
night, since it was the only place where we might
count on fair accommodations. We had gone somewhat
out of our way, for we must turn northward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
for Cashel, whose cathedral is perhaps the most remarkable
ruin in the Kingdom. It is nearly twenty
miles from Clonmel, and the road is surprisingly
good.</p>

<p>We soon came in sight of the mighty rock
which legend&mdash;ever busy in Ireland&mdash;declares was
torn from the distant hills by the enraged devil and
flung far out into the plain of Tipperary. When
the fiend performed this wonderful feat, it perhaps
did not occur to him that he was supplying a site
for a church; but had he exercised moderate foresight
he would have known that no such opportunity
would be neglected by the cathedral builders. And
so it chanced that more than a thousand years ago
the fortified church that rears its vast granite bulk
upon the rock was begun. It grew by various accretions
until it stood complete in the twelfth century.
It has passed through fire and siege, but the massy
walls are still as solid as the granite on which they
stand. The roadway winds up the side of the rock
and we are able to drive to the very entrance. A
group of youngsters is awaiting us, and one unspeakably
dirty and ragged little fellow volunteers to
&ldquo;watch the car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The custodian greets us at the gate, a keen old
fellow, well posted in the history and tradition of
his native land and speaking with little trace of
brogue. He learns that we are from America; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
brother is over there and doing well, as he reckons
it, in that Eldorado of every Irishman forced to remain
at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes! it is a great country, and how closely
the old sod is bound to it; there is no house that
you will pass in all your journeys that has not someone
there. It has been the one hope of my life to
go to America, but it has slipped away from me.
I am too old now and must die and be buried in
Cashel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said this with a look of sadness, which suddenly
forsook his face as he noted our interest in the
ruin. It was the joy of his life to tell the story of
its every nook and corner.</p>

<p>We found a strange mixture of art and crudity;
the square, unadorned lines of the walls and towers
would not lead one to expect the exquisite artistic
touches that are seen here and there. The great
structure once served the purpose of a royal residence
as well as a cathedral. The date of the stone-roofed
chapel is placed at 1127; that of the perfect round
tower is unknown, though doubtless much earlier.
The active history of the cathedral-fortress closed
with its surrender to the forces of Cromwell, which
was followed by the massacre of the garrison and
dismantling of the buildings.</p>

<p class="caption">CASHEL CATHEDRAL, TIPPERARY.</p>
</div>

<p>Our guide urges us to ascend the tower&mdash;it is
the day of all days to see the golden vale of Tip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>perary
from such a viewpoint&mdash;and indeed the prospect
proves an enchanting one. It is a perfect day
and the emerald-green valley lies shimmering under
the expanse of pale-blue sky. In the far distance on
every hand are the purple outlines of the hills&mdash;they
call them mountains in Ireland&mdash;and stretching away
toward them the pleasant fields intersected by sinuous
threads of country roads. The landscape is cut up
into little patches by the stone fences and gleams
with tiny whitewashed cottages. Flashing streams
course through the valley and herds of cattle graze
upon the luxuriant grasses. It is a scene of perfect
peace, and though the lot of the people may be
one of poverty, it is doubtless one of contentment.
Right at the foot of the ruin-crowned rock lies the
wretched little town, and on leaving the cathedral
we stop in the market place. A busy scene greets
our eyes; it is market day and the people of the
surrounding country are thronging the streets. The
market place is full of donkey carts and our car
seems in strange company. Old crones with shawls
thrown over their heads, barefooted and brown as
Indians, are selling gooseberries and cabbages.
There appears to be little else in the market and
business is far from brisk. There are many husky
farmers from the country and bright-looking young
maidens that seem of a different race from the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
market women. We see and hear much to interest
us during our hour&rsquo;s stop in Cashel.</p>

<p>To one other Tipperary shrine we must make a
pilgrimage&mdash;Holy Cross Abbey, which is only a
few miles away. We see its low square tower just
above the trees as we approach the town which
bears the same name as the abbey, and we find the
caretaker living in wretchedly dirty quarters in a part
of the ruin. A genuine surprise awaits the visitor
to Holy Cross Abbey. Like Cashel, its outlines
give no hint of the superb and even delicate touches
of art one will find about the ruin. Nothing of the
kind could be more perfect than the east window,
in which the stone tracery and slender mullions are
quite intact, and there are other windows, doors
and arches of artistic design and execution. The
abbey stands on the banks of the Suir, and it is
just across the shallow river that one gets the finest
viewpoint. It took its name from the tradition that it
once possessed a portion of the true cross which had
been given it by Queen Eleanor of England, one of
whose six sons was buried here. And thus it
chances that a brother of Richard the Lion-Hearted
sleeps amid the mouldering fragments of Holy Cross.
The footprints of history cross and recross one another
in these ancient shrines, and how often they
bring remote sections of the Kingdom to common
ground!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving Cashel on the main highway to Cork,
we begin to verify the stories we have heard of the
dreadful condition of much of the Irish roads. We
have so far found them stony, rough and ill-kept in
places, but on the whole fair to one who has had
much experience with very bad roads. But we now
come into a broad stone road that has been neglected
for years, and words are quite inadequate to characterize
it. It is a series of bumps and depressions
over which the car bounces and jumps along, seemingly
testing every bolt and rivet to the utmost. Any
speed except one so slow as to be out of the question
results in the most distressful jolting, to which
there is not a moment&rsquo;s respite. A fine gray dust
covers the road to a depth of two or three inches and
rolls away from the wheels in dense clouds. There
is considerable traffic and for several miles along one
section are military barracks; the soldiers are maneuvering
on the road with cavalry and artillery. Some
of the horses go wild at the car and it is only by
great effort that the soldiers bring them under control.
But the dust they kick up! It hangs over
the road like a fog and makes the sky seem a dull
gray. It settles thickly over the car, almost stifling
its occupants, for it is really warm. On we go&mdash;bounce,
bump, half blinded and nearly choked.
Why did we ever come to Erin, anyway?&mdash;we
could have gotten this experience at less cost nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
home. There are few towns on the road; Caher,
Mitchelstown and Fermoy, all bald and untidy, are
the only places of any size. We pass through the
&ldquo;mountains&rdquo; for a considerable distance, but the
wretched road and blinding dust distracts attention
from the country, which in places is rather pretty.
Our route is well away from the railroad and we see
much of retired rural sections which would not be
easily accessible by other means of travel. The
infrequent cottages are mean and dirty, but those
we saw later were so much worse that the recollection
of the first is nearly effaced.</p>

<p>Never did a hotel seem more inviting to us
than did the Imperial at Cork. The car and everything
about it is a dirty gray; one tire is flat, and
has been&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know how long. But we are
fortunate in our hotel and our troubles are soon forgotten.
Our room is an immense high-ceilinged
apartment with massive furniture and a vast deal of
bric-a-brac, including a plaster bust of Washington.
There are plenty of settees and easy chairs&mdash;things
uncommon enough in hotels to merit special mention.
We have an excellent dinner served just to
suit, and the experiences of the day soon begin to
appear in a different light than they did when we
were undergoing them. We are soon in the ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
tall-posted beds, clean and unspeakably comfortable,
and our sleep is too deep to even dream of Irish roads
and motor cars.</p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX">XIX</a><br />
THROUGH SOUTHERN IRELAND</h2>

<p>Cork is the gateway by which a large number
of visitors enter Ireland, and is pretty sure to be on
the route of anyone making a tour of the Island. It
manifestly has no place in this record, nor has Blarney
Castle, the most famous ruin in the world&mdash;among
Americans, at least. And yet, who could
write of an Irish tour and make no reference to
Blarney. We may be pardoned for a hasty glance
at our visit to the castle on the day after our arrival
at Cork.</p>

<p>The head porter at the Imperial, clad in his
faultless moss-green uniform, the stateliest and clearly
the most important man in the hotel, marshals
his assistants and they strap our luggage to the car&mdash;he
does no work himself, nor would anyone be so
presumptuous as to expect it of a man of such mighty
presence. We recognize the fact that his fee must
be in proportion to his dignity, and he receives it
much as his forefathers, the ancient Irish kings, exacted
tribute from their vassals. He is not content
to have us take the direct route to Blarney, only five
or six miles, but tells us of a longer but more pic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>turesque
route and gives us a rather confusing lot of
directions, which we have some little difficulty in
following. Suffice it to say that after a deal of inquiry
and much wandering through steep stony lanes&mdash;an
aggregate of more than fifteen miles out of our
way&mdash;we catch sight of the square-topped tower of
Blarney and hear the shouts and laughter of a train-load
of excursionists who are just arriving.</p>

<p>Though annoying at the time, we now have
no regret for the many miles we went astray; we saw
much of rural life along these lonely little lanes. We
passed tiny huts as wretched as any we saw in Ireland,
which is to say they were wretched beyond description;
but in them were cheery, good-natured
people whose efforts to tell us the way to Blarney
only got us farther from it.</p>

<p>Blarney Castle to some extent deserves the encomiums
that have been so lavishly heaped upon it.
It is the one place in Ireland that every tourist is expected
to see; and its fame is probably due more
to its mythical Blarney stone than to its historical
importance. As we saw it on a perfect summer
day, the great square tower with overhanging battlements
rising out of the dense emerald foliage and
darkly outlined against the bluest of Irish skies, it
seemed to breathe the very spirit of chivalry, but a
rude, barbarous chivalry, for all that. From the
tower, which we ascended by ruinous and difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
stairs, the view was magnificent, though the groves,
famous in song and story, have been largely felled.
And after all, Blarney seems rather &ldquo;blase&rdquo; on
close acquaintance, with its throngs of trippers and
souvenir hawkers at every turn. Even the Blarney
stone is a sham, a new one having been placed in a
rebuilt portion of the wall knocked down by Cromwell&rsquo;s
cannon; the original is said to be quite inaccessible.</p>

<p>During the afternoon we follow the valley of
the Lee over a road that averages fairly good and
that seldom takes us out of sight of the river. In
many places it ascends the rugged hills and affords a
far-reaching prospect over the valley. At Macroom,
the only town of any size, the road branches; one
may cross the hills and reach Killarney in only twenty
miles or may follow the coast along Kenmare
River and Dingle Bay, a total of about one hundred
and twenty miles. While we pause in the village
street, a respectable-looking citizen, divining the
cause of our hesitation, approaches us. He urges
us to take the coast route, for there is nothing finer
in Ireland. We can heartily second his enthusiastic
claims, but would go farther&mdash;there is nothing finer
in the world.</p>

<p>The Eccles Hotel is a rambling old house,
situated at the head of Bantry Bay on Glengariff
Harbor. It stands beneath the sharply rising hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
and only the highway lies between it and the water&rsquo;s
edge; the outlook from its veranda is not surpassed
by any we saw in the Kingdom, not even by the
enchanting harbor of Oban or the glorious surroundings
of Tintagel. True, we saw it at its best, just
as the sun was setting and transforming the blue
waters into a sheet of burnished gold. As far as
the eye can reach the long inlet lies between bare
granite headlands, interspersed here and there with
verdant banks, while the bright waters were dotted
with wooded islets. The sun sank beneath the
horizon, purple shadows gathered in the distance,
and the harbor gleamed mirrorlike in the twilight.
An old coast-defense castle, standing on a headland
near the entrance, lent the needed touch of human
interest to the scene. Well might Thackeray exclaim,
&ldquo;Were such a bay lying upon English shores
it would be a world&rsquo;s wonder. Perhaps if it were
on the Mediterranean or Baltic, English travellers
would flock to it by the hundreds. Why not come
and see it in Ireland?&rdquo; Indeed, more are coming
to see it today; the hotel was crowded almost to
our exclusion and we had to take what was left.
The motor is bringing many, for it is more than ten
miles from Bantry, the nearest railway station, and
is not easily accessible to travelers whose time is
somewhat limited.</p>

<p>Our route from Glengariff leads directly over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
the hills to Kenmare. The ascent is steep in places
and a long tunnel pierces the crest of the hill. We
see much weather-beaten country, stretches of purple
granite boulders devoid of vegetation and bleak
beyond description. From the summit of the hills
we glide down a winding and stony road into Kenmare,
passing with considerable difficulty many
coaches loaded with trippers, for this is a favorite
coaching route.</p>

<p>Someone has said that Ireland is like an ugly
picture set in a beautiful frame. We may dissent
from the view that the interior is ugly; we have seen
much charming country, though on the whole not
the equal of England or Scotland. The vast peat
bogs are dreary, the meadowlands monotonous, the
villages, if interesting, far from beautiful, and the detached
cottages often positively painful in their filth
and squalor. But the frame of the picture&mdash;the
glorious coast line&mdash;surely, mile for mile, its equal
may hardly be found on the globe. One will behold
every mood of sea and shore and sky; beauty
and grandeur combined and every range of coloring,
from the lucent gold of the sunset and the deep blue
stillness of the summer noonday to the gray monotone
of the storm-swept granite waste.</p>

<p>Out of Kenmare, we follow the wide estuary
of the river, leaving it only when the road sweeps
a few miles inland to the village of Sneem. And we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
behold this Sneem in astonishment; we have seen
nothing so primitive and poverty-stricken since we
landed in Ireland, nor do we see anything later that
may match it in apparent wretchedness. Two or
three long rows of low thatched-covered cottages&mdash;the
thatch green with weeds&mdash;of one or two rooms
each, with sagging doors and tiny windows, make
up the village. The interior of the huts is the plainest
imaginable; earthen floors, rough stone walls and
open roof under the rotting thatch. The cottages
surround a weed-grown common where the domestic
animals roam at will. A native approaches us,
a man of fair intelligence, who talks freely of the
wretched condition of the people. All who were
able to get away have gone to America; only the old,
the desperately poor, and the incompetent remain,
and what can one expect under such conditions?
Many eke out their existence on the money that
comes from over the sea. There is no use trying
to improve the situation; if anyone has any ambition,
there is no chance for him in Ireland, and the speaker
illustrates with concrete instances. No doubt Sneem
is typical of many retired villages. It is twenty-five
miles to the nearest railroad, and to see this phase of
Ireland the motor is indispensible.</p>

<p>The road soon takes us again to the estuary of
the Kenmare, following it to the extreme western
point of Kerry, with views of river and ocean on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
one hand and the stern granite hills on the other.
Cahersiveen is the terminus of the railway and famous
in Ireland as the birthplace of Daniel O&rsquo;Connell.
A memorial chapel of gray granite overshadows
everything else in the village, which, mean and dirty
as it is, looks live and prosperous to one coming
from Sneem. Just out of the town is the ivy-covered
ruin of Carhan House, where O&rsquo;Connell was
born.</p>

<p>I would that the language were mine to even
faintly portray the transcendent beauty of Dingle
Bay, along which we course most of the afternoon.
The day is serenely perfect and the sky is clear
save for a few fleecy clouds that drift lazily along the
horizon. Our road climbs the hills fronting on the
bay&mdash;in places the water lies almost sheer beneath
us&mdash;and the panorama that lies before us is like a
fairyland. Of the deepest liquid blue imaginable,
the still water stretches out to the hills beyond the
bay, which fade away, range after range, into the
dun and purple haze of the distance; in places their
tops are swept by low-hung clouds of dazzling
whiteness&mdash;an effect of light and color indescribably
glorious. We have seen the Scotch, Swiss and
Italian lakes, and, second to none of them, our own
Lake George, but among them all there is no match
for this splendid ocean inlet on such a day as this.
And truly, the day is the secret of the beauty; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
color and the distant hills vanish in the gray mists
that so often envelop the Irish coast.</p>

<p>It is a jar to one&rsquo;s sensibilities to pass from
such lofty and inspiring scenes into Killorglin, the
shabbiest, filthiest, most utterly devil-may-care village
we see in the Island. It does not show the almost
picturesque poverty of Sneem, but for sheer
neglect and utter lack of anything in the nature of
civic pride, we must give Killorglin the supremacy
among numerous competitors for the honor&mdash;or rather,
dishonor. The market square is covered with
masses of loose stone intermingled with filth; the
odors are what might be expected from the general
condition of the town. There is little temptation to
linger here, and we make hasty inquiries for the Killarney
road. It proves dreadfully rough and stony,
a broad and apparently once excellent highway, but
now quite neglected. There is nothing to detain us
on the way and we soon turn into the grounds of the
Victoria Hotel just before we reach Killarney.</p>

<p>The Victoria, fronting on the lake, is most pretentious,
but there are many little signs of the laxity
and untidiness that is seen everywhere in Ireland.
We wait long for a porter to remove the luggage
from the car, and finally begin the task ourselves,
when the porter appears and takes our chaffing good-naturedly.
An old lame crow&mdash;he has been a hanger-on
at the Victoria for fifteen years, the porter says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
and comes regularly to the kitchen yard for food&mdash;clings
to a chimney pot and pours out his harsh guttural
jargon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swearing at us, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; we remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; answers the ready-witted son of
Erin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just his way of expressin&rsquo; his pleasure
at your arrival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Royal Victoria boasts of even a more astonishing
array of distinguished and royal guests
than the Royal Bath at Bournemouth&mdash;both have
surely earned the prefix to their names. In the drawing-rooms
were posted letters and autographs of royalty
from King Edward (as Prince of Wales) down
to ordinary lords and ladies; and there were also
letters from other guests of distinction, including well-known
Americans. All of which only partially
atoned for the rather slack service which we found in
many particulars. Still, the Royal Victoria suffered
from no lack of patronage; we had telegraphed the
day before and yet with difficulty were able to secure
satisfactory accommodations.</p>

<p class="caption">A GLIMPSE OF THE LOUGH, IRELAND.<br />
From Original Water Color by Alexander Williams, R. I.</p>
</div>

<p>I will not write of Killarney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lakes and
Fells,&rdquo; pre-eminently the tourist center of Ireland.
The drive to Muckross Abbey and along the shores
of the lake is one of surpassing beauty, though the
road is narrow and crooked. Much of the drive is
through the private grounds of Lord Ardilaun, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
poetical title which has been accorded to Mr. Guinness,
whose &ldquo;stout&rdquo; has given him a wider and more
substantial fame than he can ever hope for from a
mere title of nobility. However, the famous product
is responsible for the title, since the wealthy
brewer was elevated to the peerage ostensibly on account
of his immense benefactions to the city of Dublin.
His Killarney house&mdash;one of several he owns in
Ireland&mdash;a modern mansion in the Elizabethan style,
may be plainly seen from the road. And one can
hardly wonder that Lord Ardilaun has thriven greatly
and built up what is freely advertised as the largest
brewery in the world, when he has such an unlimited
market for his product right at home&mdash;for
Ireland is cursed with drink perhaps beyond any
country on earth. Fortunately there is now a
marked tendency toward improvement and the Catholic
church is exerting a strong influence against the
drink evil.</p>

<p>But these reflections are not altogether germane
to the transcendent lake whose bright waters shimmer
through the trees or ripple gently on some open
beach as we course along them. Out beyond lie the
mountains against the pale sapphire sky of a perfect
summer morning, and the lake makes a glorious mirror
for its wooded islands and encircling hills. We
pass the &ldquo;meeting of the waters,&rdquo; crossing a rustic
bridge over the narrow strait. Altogether, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
a succession of delightful scenery, which the motor
car affords the ideal means of seeing.</p>

<p>But I am poorly carrying out my resolution not
to write of Killarney, though surely the theme tempts
one to linger; there is much I have not even hinted
at; Ross Castle and Muckross Abbey alone might
occupy many pages were I competent to fill them.
But we will leave them all, though we must pause
a moment in the town itself, surely a paradise for
lovers of Irish laces and for seekers after trinkets and
souvenirs galore. It is rather cleaner and more substantial
than the average small Irish town, yet Killarney
and its environs have all the earmarks of a
tourist-thronged resort and in this particular, at least,
are disappointing. While there is much of beauty
and interest, we cannot help a feeling as we leave the
town behind us that some of the encomiums may
have been a little over-enthusiastic.</p>

<p>But Killarney rapidly recedes as we hasten toward
Tralee through a country whose bleak hill-ranges
alternate with still drearier peat bogs, often
of great extent. Everywhere one sees piles of cut
and dried peat, the almost universal fuel in Ireland.
Its use is evidenced by the thin blue smoke curling
from the rude chimneys and by the pungent odor
as it falls to the earth under the lowering sky. For
the sky has become overcast and gray. We have
had&mdash;very unusual, too, they tell us&mdash;several days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
of perfect weather; the rule is almost daily showers
in Ireland during the summer.</p>

<p>We find Tralee a large, lively town; it is market
day and the narrow main street is fairly blocked
with donkey-carts, driven by screaming old women,
and the heavier, more unwieldy carts of the farmers.
The old women often go into a panic at the sight
of the motor, and grasp the donkeys by the bridle as
though these sleepy little brutes might be expected
to exhibit all the fire of a skittish horse; but never
one of them even lifts his lazy ears as the motor hums
under his nose. It is different with some of the
horses, which become unmanageable and swing the
heavy carts around in spite of all the drivers can do.
And woe to the motorist who should try conclusions
with one of these carts that may be suddenly thrown
across his way. The wreck of the car would be
almost certain and I doubt if the cart would suffer
at all. These vehicles are primitive in the extreme;
two massive wheels, an oaken beam axle and two
shafts made of heavy timbers, is about all there is
to one of them. It is with such vehicles that Tralee
swarms and our progress to the market square is
slow indeed. In the midst of the market place
stands a monument surmounted by the figure of a
peasant soldier, the inscriptions commemorating the
Irish patriots of &rsquo;98, &rsquo;03, &rsquo;48 and &rsquo;67, and declaring
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>&ldquo;undying allegiance of the Irish people to
republican principles.&rdquo; The hotel where we stop
for luncheon is a large limestone building, just opposite
the monument. It is fairly clean and the service
cannot be complained of; Irish hotels have averaged
better than we had been led to expect.</p>

<p>From Tralee we take a rough, neglected road
to Tarbert-on-Shannon, running through a desolate
hill country&mdash;the Stacks Mountains, as they appear
to Irish eyes&mdash;almost devoid of trees, with mean and
often unspeakably filthy huts at long intervals. Most
of these huts have but two small rooms; in one the
domestic animals&mdash;the horse, donkey or cow, with
a pig or two squealing under foot&mdash;and in the other
the family. One is quite as clean and comfortable
as the other. The muck-heap is squarely in front
of the door; it would be too much trouble to put
it to the rear, and it is probably cleared away once
or twice a year. But withal, the people are probably
happier than the nobles in their castles; a merry,
laughing, quick-witted folk who greet us with good-natured
shouts of welcome&mdash;there is no prejudice
against the motor here. The cheeriness of the people
contrasts with the bleak and depressing country itself,
today wrapped in a gray mist that half obscures
the view.</p>

<p>As we passed through one of the bogs, an incident
occurred that added to the gloom of the day,
and the poverty of the country still leaves a somber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
impression on our minds. It was a peasant funeral
procession, forty or fifty of the rude carts such as we
have described wending their way along the wretched
road. The plain pine coffin, fastened with knotted
hempen ropes, was borne on a cart similar to the
others, and yet the deceased was evidently a person
of importance, indicated by the large following and
several priests in the center of the procession. As we
came up they motioned us to pass, and our car crept
by as stealthily as possible, though not without disturbing
some of the horses. All treated it with good-natured
solemnity and many saluted us as we passed.
Farther along the road we saw many people at the
cottages in readiness to join the procession when it
reached them. The incident could not but impress
us with the poverty and really primitive character of
the Irish peasants of the inland hills&mdash;people and a
country quite unknown to those who follow the ordinary
routes of travel.</p>

<p>Listowel is twenty miles from Tralee, a dilapidated
hamlet surrounding a great gloomy-looking
church, and above it the shattered towers of the
ever-present castle peeping out of a mass of ivy.
Ten miles farther over a rough road and we enter
Tarbert on a fine wooded headland overlooking the
lordly Shannon&mdash;truly worthy of such title here&mdash;a
sweeping river two or three miles in width. For
twenty miles or more our road closely follows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
southern shore of the broad estuary, and we realize
keenly how much of color and distance one loses
when the gray rain obscures the landscape. The
estuary of the Shannon might well vie with Dingle
Bay under conditions similar to those of the preceding
day, but we see only a leaden sheet of water
fading away in the fitful showers or lying sullenly
under the dim outlines of the coast of County Clare.</p>

<p>At Glin we pass beneath the ancient stronghold
of the &ldquo;Knight of Glin,&rdquo; which recalls the splendor
of a feudal potentate who in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time
was lord of an estate of six hundred thousand acres,
and whose personal train included five hundred gentlemen.
So much glory and an Irish tendency to
take a hand in the frequent broils in the west, brought
the English Lord President of Ireland with a strong
besieging force. The defense was desperate in the
extreme. The young son of the lord of the castle was
captured by the besiegers and placed in a post of
great danger in hope of checking the fire of the garrison;
but the ruse had no effect on the furious Irishmen
in the fortress. When at last a breach had been
made by a heavy cannonade and the fall of the
castle became inevitable, the few remaining defenders,
uttering the ancient warcry of their house, flung
themselves from the shattered battlements into the
river. After a lapse of more than three hundred
years, one may still see the marks of the cannon-shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
upon the heavy walls. And this weird story of
the defense of Glin Castle is typical of tales that may
be told of hundreds of the mouldering ruins of Ireland.</p>

<p>At Foynes the river broadens still more; &ldquo;the
spacious Shenan, spreading like a sea,&rdquo; was how it
impressed Edmund Spenser, who has left in his
poems many traces of his Irish wanderings. But we
see little of it in the increasing drizzle that envelops
it. Our road turns farther inland to Askeaton, a
bedraggled collection of little huts, beneath the lordly
ruin of Desmond Castle. There is little else to
engage us on our way to Limerick, though we pass
through the Vale of Adare, of which the bard has
so musically sung:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O sweet Adare, O lovely vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O safe retreat of sylvan splendor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor summer sun nor morning gale<br /></span>
<span class="i2">E&rsquo;er hailed a scene so sweetly tender.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But it is not so sweetly tender on a dark drizzly
evening, and we rush on through the rain to the
shelter of an old-time hostelry in Limerick.</p>

<p>Cruise&rsquo;s Royal is a large plain building perhaps
a century or two old and quite unpretentious
and comfortable. Limerick is not frequented by
tourists and little special provision has been made
to entertain them. It is a city of nearly fifty thous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>and
people and has large business interests in different
lines. But Limerick has a past, despite its modern
activity. Its castle, standing directly on the
Shannon, was built by King John in 1205, and the
seven original circular towers are still intact. The
cathedral of St. Mary&rsquo;s is even older than the castle,
and though restored, many touches of antiquity still
remain. The Roman Catholic cathedral of St.
John&rsquo;s is one of the finest modern churches in Ireland,
its splendid spire rising to a height of three
hundred feet. Its magnificence ill accords with
the wretched hovels that crowd around it; for the
Irish Catholic seems to take far more pride in his
church than in his own home. There is a large
percentage of English among the inhabitants of Limerick,
which is no doubt a factor in its business progressiveness.
The shops which we visited would
compare favorably with those of a city of the same
size almost anywhere. One of the staple products
is Limerick lace and it is sold here at prices so low,
compared with the tourist towns, as to quite astonish
one.</p>

<p>But the chief glory of Limerick is its broad river,
so vast and so cleansed by the sea tide as to
show little trace of pollution, even in the city limits.
It is spanned by two fine bridges, that nearest the
castle replacing one built by King John. At the
west end of this bridge is the famous <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>&ldquo;Stone of
the Violated Treaty,&rdquo; mounted on a properly inscribed
pedestal. The treaty with William and
Mary was signed on this stone, but the English
Parliament repudiated the agreement, and hence the
name.</p>

<p>In leaving Limerick, we closely followed the
Shannon, and a magnificent stream it is, lying in
wide, lakelike stretches and rippling gently in the
fresh sea breeze. The valley here is quite level and
covered with emerald verdure to the very banks, between
which the river flashes in gemlike brilliancy.
It would be a joy to follow the Shannon and the
loughs, in which it rests itself at frequent intervals,
to its very source, every mile rich in historic interest
and storied ruins; but we may go no farther than
Killaloe, at the southern end of Lough Derg, about
fifteen miles from Limerick. Here is a venerable
cathedral church, built about 1150, upon the site
of a still older church founded in the sixth century.
And it is to this latter time that most authorities
refer the stone-roofed chapel or oratory standing near
the cathedral. Legend has it that this was built
by St. Flannan, who founded the original cathedral;
and certain it is that its antiquity is very great. One
experiences strange sensations as he stands in this
rude, unfurnished little structure. It forcefully brings
to him the fact that Christianity and learning are
older in Ireland than in England and Scotland; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
this chapel was probably built before St. Augustine
landed in Kent; that it was from Ireland that Christian
missionaries sailed to teach the savage Britons
and marauding Picts.</p>

<p>We cross the river over a high-arched bridge,
near which is an attractive new hotel, for tourists and
fishermen are learning of the beauties of the Shannon
and Lough Derg. We soon reach Nenagh on
the Dublin road, and the graceful church spire at
once attracts our attention. We can scarce forbear
an exclamation of surprise as we come into full view
of the splendid structure, just from the builder&rsquo;s
hand. It is truly a poem in gray stone, as fine an
example of gothic architecture as we have seen in
the Kingdom&mdash;proof that the spirit of the old cathedral
builders lingers still, at least in Ireland. A
young man approaches us as we stand in the churchyard
and informs us that the church has just been
completed at a cost of fifty thousand pounds. We
should have guessed much more, but labor and stone
are cheap in Ireland; such a structure could hardly
have been erected in America for less than half a
million dollars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where did all the money come from?&rdquo;
for Nenagh shows little evidence of wealth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, they have been long in raising it and much
of it came from America.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">ANCIENT ORATORY, KILLALOE.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>The church inside is hardly in keeping with
the exterior, but this will no doubt be remedied in
time. At the door is a table covered with pamphlets,
with a notice requesting the visitor to place a penny
in the box for each copy taken. We noted the titles
of several: &ldquo;Health and Cleanliness in Irish
Homes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Temperance Catechism, Showing the
Evils of Drink,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ireland, the Teacher of England
and Scotland,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Evils of Emigration,&rdquo; (in
which no very glowing picture of the prospects of
the emigrant in America is shown), and many others
on Irish history and Catholic heroes. Nearly all of
the dozen booklets which we select are really excellent
and show that the Catholic Church in Ireland
is awakening to the necessities of modern conditions.</p>

<p>From the church our guide led us to the castle
near at hand and secured the key. There is little
left save the stupendous keep, a circular tower about
one hundred feet high and perhaps sixty feet in diameter.
The walls at the bottom have the amazing
thickness of eighteen feet and one would reckon
this mighty tower as well-nigh impregnable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Destroyed by Cromwell,&rdquo; said our guide,
&ldquo;who burned the castle and razed it to the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as we are about to leave a very recently
acquired distinction of Nenagh occurs to our guide&mdash;the
town is the home of the grandfather of Hayes,
the American runner who won the Marathon race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
at London. The old man keeps a baker shop down
the street and the hero is here even now&mdash;a twofold
hero, indeed, as an Irishman by descent and as
a winner over the English contestants. We pause
at the little shop, but the hero is out and we have to
be content with a few purchases. We find some
difficulty in getting out of the town, but after much
inquiry a policeman starts us on the Dublin road.</p>

<p>And here I might speak a word of the Irish
policeman. As in England, he is everywhere and
always ready with information; no matter how dirty
and squalid the surroundings, he is neat, in a faultless
moss-green uniform emblazoned with the gold
harp of Erin. He is always conscious of his dignity
as the representative of law and order, and one can
easily imagine that his presence must have a calming
effect on the proverbial Irish tendency for a row.
He is indeed a worthy part of the unequaled police
system of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The road which we now followed runs through
the very heart of the Island, a distance of one hundred
miles from Nenagh to Dublin. It is in the
main a broad, well-surfaced highway with even
grades and slight curves. It passes through a much
better and more prosperous-looking country than the
extreme southern portion of the Island. The farm
cottages are better and apparently cleanlier, but the
towns show little improvement. Nearly all of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
are poor and mean-looking, with aged, weather-beaten
buildings and many tumble-down houses.
They are a good distance apart; Roscrea, Mountrath,
Maryborough, Kildare and Naas are the larger
places on the road. Only two call for especial mention&mdash;one
for its dilapidation and filthiness and the
other for rather the opposite qualities. The first distinction
we may freely accord to Maryborough, the
county town of Queens County, with a population
of about three thousand. Perhaps we saw it at its
worst, for it was the weekly market day. The market
place was blocked with live stock, and it was
with difficulty that we forced the car through the
seething mass. The streets were covered with loose
stones, straw and filth, and on the sidewalks, little
pens were fenced off and filled with calves and hogs.
The farmers circulated among the animals and regarded
us rather sullenly for Irishmen. Our luncheon
hour was past and we looked dubiously toward
the Maryborough hotel. A native, divining
our situation, cast a disgusted glance at the wretched
surroundings and said, &ldquo;You had better go on to
Kildare; you will find it much better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We thank him and the car spurns the dirt of
Maryborough under her wheels as she springs forward
on the twenty miles of fine road to Kildare.
We find this town small and rather poor, but far
cleanlier than its neighbor. It has an ancient cathe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>dral
church and one of the most notable of the round
towers, one hundred and five feet high, though somewhat
spoiled by a modern battlemented effect in
place of the usual conical top. But the joy of Kildare
is its hotel, a new, bright-looking brick structure,
delightfully pleasant and homelike inside.
There is a piano in the parlor and fresh flowers on
the mantelpiece. Our tea is soon ready in the dining-room,
as cleanly and well ordered as the best across
the Channel, and the neat waiter girls serve us
promptly. Of course there is a secret somewhere to
all this wonder, and we fathom it when we learn that
the railroad owns the hotel. May the railroads build
more hotels in Ireland!</p>

<p>At Newbridge, a few miles farther, are extensive
barracks, a city of red brick, where a large body
of Irish troops is quartered. Military life appeals to
a great number of Irishmen and some of the crack
British regiments are recruited in the Island. The
Irishman may justly be proud of his reputation as a
fighting man and he never wearies of telling you of
the nativity of the Duke of Wellington and of Lord
Roberts, the present chief of the British army. A
fine racing course also lies between Newbridge and
Kildare, and races famous throughout the country
are held here annually.</p>

<p>Our Irish pilgrimage is at an end; we leave
Dublin on the following day, not without reluctance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
and regret. This Ireland is very old and very interesting,
and it is with a feeling of distinct sadness
that we watch her lessening shores. We find ourselves
secretly hoping to come again some day with
out trusty companion of the winged wheels, to spend
a whole summer among the hills and dales, the rivers
and loughs of the &ldquo;Ould Countree.&rdquo;</p>

SOME ODDS AND ENDS</h2>

<p>Holyhead is an inconsequential town whose
chief end is to serve as a port of departure for Ireland.
Were it not for this useful purpose, few tourists
would ever see it&mdash;or the Isle of Anglesea, for
that matter. Aside from some fine coast scenery
and the castle, now very ruinous, built by Edward
I. at Beaumaris, Anglesea offers little
in the way of attractions. The island is rather
barren, with here and there a mean-looking village
with a long, unpronounceable Welsh name. The
main road from the great suspension bridge over the
Menai Strait to Holyhead is excellent, but nearly all
others in the island are so bad as to discourage motorists.</p>

<p>The Station Hotel at Holyhead is owned by
the Northwestern Railway, and would be creditable
to a city of one hundred thousand. It affords
every comfort to its guests, and the railway people
have made special provisions for the motor car,
among these one of the best-equipped garages that
I saw anywhere. The motor is becoming a serious
rival to the railway in Britain, the heavy reduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
in first-class passenger travel being attributed to the
popularity of the horseless carriage; but the situation
has been accepted by the companies which own
hotels and they have generally provided first-class accommodation
for cars belonging to their guests.</p>

<p>In a previous chapter I referred to our run from
London to Holyhead, reaching Ludlow the first
night. I am going to have my say about Ludlow in
another chapter; for five visits on different occasions
to the delightful old border town should perhaps
entitle me, though a stranger to its people, to
record my impressions of it somewhat in detail.</p>

<p>Bishop&rsquo;s Castle marked our entrance into the hill
country of Northern Wales. It is a lonely town following
a steep, roughly-paved main street, at the
top of which we stop for luncheon at an old-fashioned
but very pleasant country inn. From Bishop&rsquo;s
Castle to Barmouth by the way of Welshpool, Llanfair,
Dinas Mawddwy and Dolgelley, we pass
through the very heart of North Wales and see many
phases of its beauty, though generally in the wilder
and sterner moods. The hills are often steep, but
from their crests we have far-reaching views over
the wooded vales and green hill ranges. In places
we wind through tangled forests or run along the
banks of swift little rivers. At Dinas Mawddwy we
enter the Welsh mountains, the most imposing hills
in Britain. The tiny village nestling beside its rip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>pling
river seems lost in the mighty hills that overhang
it on every side, rugged and almost precipitous,
yet velvety green to their very summits. We begin
our climb out of the valley over the Bwlch
Ooeddrws Pass&mdash;the name is even more alarming
than the heavy grade shown in the road book&mdash;and
for three miles we climb steadily up the mighty hill
alongside an incline that drops sharply to the roaring
stream far below. From the summit a grand
prospect greets our eyes: the wild, broken, intensely
green Welsh hills stretching away range after range
until they fade in the purple shadows of the distance,
and yet higher above us looms the crest of Cader
Idris, on which still linger flecks of snow. After a
short pause to contemplate the beauty of the scene,
we plunge down the descent, steep, sinuous and
rough, to Dolgelley, lying at the foot of the hill, a
retired little town with a long history; for here the
Welsh hero, Owen Glendwr, held his parliaments
and made a rallying point for his adherents in North
Wales. Today its old-time, gray-stone, slate-roofed
houses are hemmed in by more modern villas such
as one now finds in most of the beauty spots of
northern Wales.</p>

<p>The ten miles of road to Barmouth follows
the estuary of the river with only moderate grades until
it reaches the town, when it plunges down the
long hill to the seashore. Barmouth, or, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
Welsh style it, Abermaw, is a quiet watering-place
lying along a narrow beach at the foot of the hills
that rise almost sheer behind the town. The coast
line of the wide rock-bound harbor is wild and broken,
and the view over the estuary at sunset is an
enchanting one. The hotels are rather small and
the beginning of the crowded season is just at hand.
Should one wish to remain for a time in Barmouth
to explore some of the grandest scenery in Wales,
he would be more at ease in May or June.</p>

<p>As we leave the town an obliging garage man
hails us and warns us to beware of Llanaber, two
or three miles to the north; a trap for motorists has
been set there, and as if to convince us that wealth
and station will not protect us, he adds in a rather
awe-stricken manner that Her Grace the Duchess
of W&mdash;&mdash;, wife of the richest nobleman in the Kingdom,
was stopped last week and fined ten pounds.
We feel that a contribution to the exchequer of Llanaber
would hardly come so easy from us as from the
wealthy duchess, and we pass through the wretched
little hamlet at a most respectful pace. The rain
has begun to fall heavily and has apparently dampened
the ardor of the Welsh constables, for we see
nothing of them. The road continues many miles
between the mountain slope and the low green
marshes stretching seaward, but the driving rain obscures
the view. At only one point does the ocean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
lash the rocks directly beneath us; elsewhere along
the coast the road is separated from the sea by
marshes and stretches of sandy beach, varying from
a few hundred feet to two miles in width.</p>

<p>Suddenly the gray bulk of Harlech Castle,
standing on its commanding eminence, four square
to all the winds of heaven, looms up grim and vast
in the gusty rain. It is the last of the great feudal
castles of Britain that we are to see on our pilgrimage&mdash;save
some of those we have seen before&mdash;and it
marks a fitting close to the long list that we have
visited&mdash;nearly every one of importance in the Island.</p>

<p>Harlech is one of the seven great castles built
by Edward I. in his effort to subdue Wales. It contests
with Carnarvon and Conway for first place
among the Welsh ruins and is easily one of the half
dozen most remarkable castellated fortresses in the
Kingdom. It is perched on a mighty rock which
drops almost sheer to the wide, sandy marsh along
the sea, and just below it on the landward side is the
village that gives the castle its name. Inside the
great quadrangle, we find the trim neatness that
characterizes the ruins belonging to the crown. We
ascend the stairway leading to the battlements and
follow the path around the walls and towers. A
thousand pities that the rain shuts out the view, for
surely there are few such panoramas of sea and
mountain in Britain as one may get from the walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
of Harlech. Shall we let one more fortunate than
we, having seen the prospect on a cloudless day, tell
its beauty in poetic phrase?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a scene of unparalleled beauty, whichever
way one turns; whether to the sea, out beyond the
sandy beach at the foot of Castle Rock, running far
away, a sheet of intensest blue, until it meets the
pale sapphire of the sky; or whether toward the
mountains of the north, Snowdon, the snow-crowned
king of them all, rising in matchless majesty above
his satellites; or to the landward where the tiny village
nestles at the foot of craglike hills; or to the
westward where the great promontory of Lleyn
stretches away, throwing here and there into the sky
its isolated peaks, so full of savage sternness tempered
with weird beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verily, these misty days in Britain often hide
visions of beauty from one&rsquo;s eager eyes. We will ask
little of the story of Harlech, but it is a stirring one.
It saw strenuous times as a stronghold of Owen
Glendwr, who captured it in 1404 and held it against
the forces of Henry IV., who re-took the castle four
years later, driving the Welsh prince into the mountains.
Here came Margaret, the queen of the Sixth
Henry, during the war of the Roses, and the castle
yielded, only after a long siege, to the onslaught of
the adherents of the House of York. Indeed, Har<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>lech
was the last fortress in England to hold out for
the Lancastrian cause. But far more memorable
than the siege are the wild swinging cadences of the
&ldquo;March of the Men of Harlech,&rdquo; to which the conflict
gave birth. During the civil war, the castle
was the last in Wales to hold out for King Charles,
and its story closes with its surrender to the army
of the Commonwealth in 1647.</p>

<p>The rain ceases shortly after we leave Harlech,
and the air becomes clear, though the sky is still overcast.
It is fortunate, for we see some of the wildest
and most impressive of Welsh scenery. Great clifflike
hills, splashed with red shale and purple heather
or clad in the somber green of the pines, rise abruptly
from the roadside. At Beddgelert the beauty culminates
in one of the finest scenes in Wales. The valley,
a plot of woods and meadows, is surrounded on
every hand by the giant hills, whose sides glow with
red and purple rock which crops out among the
scattered pines that climb to the very crests. Two
clear, dashing mountain streams join their waters to
form the river Glaslyn, which winds through a
mighty gorge to the sea; and alongside the river
runs the perfect road over which we have just been
coursing. The Royal Goat, right by the roadside,
invites us to pause for our late luncheon; a charming
old-fashioned inn, odd as its name, but homelike and
hospitable. At Beddgelert the beauty begins to fade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
and one sees only commonplace country and barren
hills until he reaches Carnarvon.</p>

<p class="caption">ON THE RIVER LLEDR, WALES.<br />
From Original Painting by Daniel Sherrin.</p>
</div>

<p>Returning from Holyhead, we followed the
fine coast road from Bangor to Conway, where we
paused to renew our acquaintance with one of the
most charming towns in the Kingdom. In many
respects it is unique, for nowhere will one find more
perfect relics of feudal time, or feel more thoroughly
its spirit than at Conway. The little city still lies
snugly behind its ancient wall, whose one and twenty
watch towers stand grimly as of old, though shorn of
their defenders in these piping times of peace. And
the castle, from many viewpoints the most picturesque
of them all, looks marvelously perfect from a little
distance&mdash;so perfect that one could hardly wonder
to see a flash of armor from the stately battlements.
Yet with all its antiquity, Conway, inside its walls,
is clean and neat and has an air of quiet prosperity.
So widely known are its charms that perhaps it
should have no place in this record; and yet it is
probable that the great majority of American visitors
in England never see Conway&mdash;which assumption
is my excuse for a few words of appreciation.</p>

<p>If there were no castle or wall, there would be
ample warrant for coming to see one of the most
charming Elizabethan mansions in the Island. Plas
Mawr&mdash;the Great House&mdash;indeed deserves its
name; a huge building of many gables, odd corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
and stone-mullioned, diamond-paned windows. Inside
there are great paneled rooms with richly bossed
plaster ceilings, wide fireplaces with mantelpieces
emblazoned with the arms of the ancient owners,
and many narrow winding passageways leading&mdash;you
never quite learn whither. Very appropriate is
the ghostly legend of the house, and even more fitting
the better substantiated story of the visit of Queen
Elizabeth&mdash;that splendid royal traveler who might
well be our patron saint. Stately is the great chamber,
the sitting-room of the Queen&rsquo;s suite, with its
paneled walls, its highly ornate ceiling, its great
group of no less than a dozen windows; and the
fireplace, six feet or more across, where a great log
might be thrown to glow, a solid core of heat&mdash;fit
indeed for the evening musings of the royal guest.</p>

<p>A thorough round of Plas Mawr will serve to
give one an appetite for luncheon at the Castle Hotel&mdash;at
least this was the result in our particular case.
But one would not really need much of an appetite
to be tempted by the luncheon set forth at the Castle
Hotel, one of the cleanest, brightest and best-ordered
of the many inns at which we stopped in our wanderings.</p>

<p>In a jaunt up the Conway River, one will see
much pleasing scenery of hill, valley and river,
and will come at Bettws-y-Coed into the Holyhead
road, which splendid highway we follow through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
Llangollen and Oswestry to Shrewsbury. This
route abounds in interest; Chirk is famous for its
castle and there is an ivy-covered ruin at Whittington,
but we do not pause in our swift flight for any
of them. The sky has cleared and delightful vistas
greet our eyes as we hasten through &ldquo;the sweet vale
of Llangollen.&rdquo; We come into Shrewsbury almost
ere we know it, and a half hour later catch sight of
the great church tower of Ludlow town.</p>

</div>

<p>A longing for a farewell glimpse of Warwickshire
comes upon us as we leave Ludlow on the
afternoon of the following day; and what pleasanter
memory could we choose for the closing days of our
long pilgrimage in England than a flight through the
charming country that lies at her very heart? True,
we will pass over roads that we have traversed before,
but could one ever weary of Stratford and Warwick
and Coventry, and of the quiet Midlands that
lie about them?</p>

<p>We pause for one last look at the cathedral
at Worcester, its great tower of warm red stone
standing sharp against the cloudless sky; it is altogether
one of the most perfect in proportion and
design of all the churches in the Island. Then we
hasten through the summer landscape&mdash;its prevailing
green dashed with the pale gold of the yellowing
harvests&mdash;to Droitwich and through Alcester, with
its dull-red brick and black-oak beams, into the now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
familiar streets of Stratford-on-Avon. We pause
at the busy souvenir store of which two years before
the white-haired mayor was proprietor; but he has
since retired, his successor tells us. As one of the
notables of the town, he points out Miss Corelli,
the novelist, who has made her home in Stratford
and waxed rich through much advertising, which
sometimes assumed forms highly distasteful to her
fellow-townsmen. For it chanced that one Andrew
Carnegie would present a handsome library building
to Stratford should the town provide a suitable site,
but for some reason Miss Corelli objected, and by
engaging the plan in some of the endless legal quibbles
possible in England, she defeated it. The
mayor was vexed beyond measure and when the
attorney for Miss Corelli interrogated him,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not say that you would give a thousand
pounds to get Miss Corelli out of Stratford?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never said so,&rdquo; replied his honor, &ldquo;but
though a thousand pounds does not grow on a gooseberry
bush for me, I really believe I would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This retort so irritated the authoress that she
brought an action for libel and was awarded a
farthing damages. But this bit of gossip hardly accords
with the spirit of Stratford at the coming of
twilight, when the low sun flashes on the still bosom
of the immemorial Avon and pierces the gloom beneath
the great trees that cluster around the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>We come here again from Coventry on the
following day to join the worshipers in the fane
where sleeps the Master of English Letters. It is a
perfect day and the large light-toned windows lend
an air almost of cheerfulness to the graceful interior
of Stratford Church, and the great organ fills it with
noble melody. With such surroundings, perhaps
we miss much of the sermon&mdash;at least we can recall
nothing of it in the lapse of time&mdash;but the
memories that come back to us now are of the
mingled feelings of reverence and inspiration that
dominated us during the hour we lingered.</p>

<p>As we leave the church&mdash;our car has stood by
the roadside the while&mdash;an intelligent little fellow
approaches us, urging his services as guide, and he
looks so longingly at the car that we take him in.
In all our wanderings about Stratford, and hardly a
highroad or byway has escaped us, we have missed
the old cottage where Mary Arden is said to have
lived. Is said to have lived&mdash;alas, that hypothetical
&ldquo;said&rdquo; that flings its blight over so many of our
sacred shrines. But what matters it, after all?
What mattered it to the pious votary of olden time
that the relics of his revered saint, so fraught with
comfort and healing to him, turned out to be the
bones of a goat? There shall be no question for
us on this perfect day of English summer that the
low gray walls and sagging dull-red tile roof of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
cottage before us once sheltered the mother of Shakespeare.
It stands behind a low stone wall, in the
village of Wilmcote, two or three miles from Stratford,
a blaze of old-fashioned flowers in front of it
and creepers and rose vines clamber over its gray
walls. It is only a farmhouse tenement now, but
with the old buildings grouped about it and its
dovecot, it makes a picture well suited to the glamour
that legend throws about the place. Our small guide
eagerly points it out and proposes to seek admittance
for us; but we desire no such disenchantment as
this would likely bring. We ask him to point the
way to Shottery, for we wish a final glimpse of
Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s cottage, whose authenticity is
only a shade better attested than that of the home of
Mary Arden.</p>

<p>The road from Stratford to Banbury is winding
and steep in places, and Sun-Rising Hill is known
over the Kingdom as the most formidable in the
Midland Country; the road climbs it in sweeping
curves and the increasing grade brings the motor to
&ldquo;low&rdquo; ere we reach the top. But the prospect which
greets one from its summit makes the climb worth
while, a panorama of green and gold fading into
the purple haze of distance. The Red Lion at
Banbury appeals to us and we rest awhile in the
courtyard after luncheon. Along the walls directly
in front of us, a blaze of purple bloom, stretches the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
&ldquo;largest wisteria in England,&rdquo; one hundred and
eighty feet in length, its stem like a good-sized tree.
It has been thus with so many of the old-time inns;
each has had some peculiar charm. But surely no
architect ever planned the Red Lion Inn; it is a
rambling building that seems to have grown up with
the years. No straight line curbs its walls; none of
its floors maintain the same level; it is a maze of
strangely assorted apartments, narrow, winding hallways
and odd nooks and corners.</p>

<p>The road we follow to Daventry is a retired
one, very narrow and almost lost in places between
high hedges and over-arching trees. It leads through
quaint villages, snug and cozy among the hills,
seemingly little disturbed by the workaday world
beyond. What a change it is to come into the
Holyhead road at Daventry, the splendid highway
that charms one more and more every time he passes
over it; and did ever anyone see it more golden and
glorious than we as we hasten toward Coventry in
the face of the setting sun? The giant elms and yews
and pines that border the road stand sharply against
the wide bar of lucent gold that sweeps around the
horizon, flecked here and there with purple and
silver clouds. Soon the three slender spires of the
old city loom out of the purple mists that hover over
it and stand in clear outline against the sunset sky,
a scene of calm and inspiring beauty. As we come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
nearer the shadows resolve themselves into the houses
of the charming old town, in the heart of which we
come to our pleasant inn.</p>

<p>There is little more to be told; our second long
pilgrimage through the sunlit fields and rain-swept
wolds of Britain and Ireland draws near its close.
We take our final leave of Coventry with keen regret
and soon come into the Northamptonshire Hills.
We see the Bringtons again, far more delightful under
cloudless skies than in the gray summer shower
that wrapped the little hamlets during our former
visit.</p>

<p>Beyond Northampton, a memory of Ben
Franklin brings us to Ecton, apparently the sleepiest
of Midland villages. We follow the straggling line
of thatched cottages to the church, where gray
stones with almost illegible inscriptions mark the
graves of Eleanor and Thomas Franklin, uncle and
aunt of one who, in some respects, was our greatest
American. The Franklin manor house is gone and
Benjamin himself had little to do with Ecton save
as a visitor to his ancestral home. He relates that
in searching the parish records he learned that he
was the youngest son of the youngest son for no
less than five generations&mdash;verily, genius has little
respect for the law of primo-geniture so sacred in
England. His grandfather, also a Benjamin, left
Ecton for London, where he engaged in the dyer&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
trade and varied the drudgery of his calling by
writing much poetry of doubtful merit. His youngest
son, Josias, emigrated to America in 1682, and
the rest is American history, too well known to
need recording here. Ecton, somnolent and remote,
seems little conscious today of the achievements
of the mighty son of her Franklin squires of a few
centuries ago.</p>

<p>At Bedford, the brightest and most progressive-looking
of English towns, we enter the old home of
Howard, who civilized the prisons of the world and
whose memory is kept green by the excellent work
of the Howard societies of our own and other
countries. Near at hand is the Bunyan memorial
chapel, with many relics of the author of &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress.&rdquo; And one is mildly astonished to see the
collection of the works of this famous preacher and
to note how &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; outshone and survived
a flood of mediocre, if not stupid, theological
writings which he poured forth. We hasten onward
through Cambridge, and night finds us at the Angel
in Bury St. Edmunds. Of our last day&rsquo;s wanderings
I have already told in my chapter on East
Anglia.</p>

<p>Travel-stained but unwearied, the tried and
trusty companion of our pilgrimage stands before
our London hotel. It is hard to think of her&mdash;is
the pronoun right?&mdash;as a thing of iron and steel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
she has won a personality to us; but, metaphor
aside, what a splendid means to a splendid end the
motor has become! In two summers we have seen
more of Britain than one might find it practicable
to see in years under old conditions, and we have
seen the most delightful, though unfamiliar, side. I
trust that some small measure of our appreciation has
been reflected in these pages, though I well recognize
that neither the words nor the power to use
them are mine by which there might be conveyed
a truly adequate idea of such a pilgrimage.</p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI">XXI</a><br />
LUDLOW TOWN</h2>

<p>I am going to write a chapter, though it be
a short one, on Ludlow Town, which, among the
hundreds of places rich in historic association and
redolent of romance that we visited in our wanderings,
still continues pre-eminent in our memories.
We took occasion to pause here four or five times
for the night, and each succeeding sojourn only
served to heighten our appreciation of the delightful
old town and its traditions. One will not tire of
the Feathers Inn&mdash;surely one of the most charming
of the very old hostelries and noted as one of the
best preserved brick-and-timber houses in the Kingdom.
True, copious applications of black and white
paint gives it a somewhat glaring appearance, but the
beauty of the sixteenth century facade with its jutting
gables, carved beams and antique windows, will
appeal to the most casual beholder. The interior
is old-fashioned, but comfortable withal, and an
air of quiet pervades the place. It is not without a
touch of modernity, for between our first and last
visit gas lights superseded candles. On one occasion,
when the Feathers was full, we went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
Angel and will not soon forget the portly Boniface
who welcomed us: a mighty man indeed, who
might well be the prince of inn-keepers and who
would tip the scale at not less than twenty-five stone&mdash;for
thus they reckon ones weight in England.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more delightful on the evening
of a fine summer day than to wander about the
town and to view the church tower and castle walls
from different angles. Our favorite walk was over
the castle bridge and along the river, whose waters
beyond the weir lay broad and still, reflecting the
gray towers far above. One will find few more
romantic sights than the rugged bulk of Ludlow
Castle, standing on its clifflike eminence in sharp outline
against the evening sky. Just beneath rise the
ranks of stately lime trees bordering the pleasant walk
cut in the hill slope, which falls sharply to a narrow
bank along the river. One may complete the circuit
by following the path between the trees and
making a rather steep descent to the road along
the bank.</p>

<p>The river above the weir is radiant with the
reflected glories of the skies; and the rush of the
falling water alone breaks on the evening stillness.
We linger long; the crimson fades from the heavens
and river, but a new, almost ethereal beauty possesses
the scene under the dominance of a full summer
moon. The walls and towers lose their traces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
decay in the softened light, and one might easily
imagine Ludlow Castle, proud and threatening, as
it stood in the good old times. Did we catch a
glint of armor on yonder grim old tower, or a gleam
of rushlight through its ruinous windows? But our
reverie vanishes as the notes of &ldquo;Home Sweet Home&rdquo;
come to us, clear and sweet from the church tower
chime.</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="caption">LUDLOW CASTLE, THE WALK BENEATH THE WALL.</p>
</div>

<p>I wish I might write the fuller story of the castle,
but its eight hundred years were too eventful for the
limits of my book. A few scattered incidents of
its romance are all that I may essay&mdash;and one can but
keenly regret that Walter Scott did not throw the
enchantment of his story over Ludlow rather than
the less deserving Kenilworth.</p>

<p>The castle was built soon after the Conquest,
and its warlike history begins with a siege by King
Stephen, who wrested it from its founders, the
Mortimers, and presented it to his favorite, the
doughty warrior, Joce de Dinan. He greatly enlarged
and improved it, but was sorely troubled by
Hugh Mortimer, the erstwhile lord of the castle,
who soon made open war upon its new possessor.
Joce was no match for his adversary in men and
wealth, but managed to capture Mortimer by
strategy and imprisoned him in the tower which still
bears his name. His captivity was not of long dur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>ation,
since Joce allowed him to purchase his freedom
at the cost of a large part of his wealth.</p>

<p>After this, according to the old chronicles, began
the bloody strife between de Dinan and the
DeLacys over a portion of an estate in the valley of
the Teme. Finally, after many fierce conflicts, the
two feudal lords met face to face under the walls
of Ludlow and engaged in deadly combat. The
redoubtable Joce had just worsted his opponent
when three of the latter&rsquo;s followers appeared on the
scene, and finding the lord of Ludlow already wounded
and quite exhausted, his defeat and even death
at the hands of his enemies seemed imminent. From
the castle towers his lady and fair daughters, Sybil
and Hawyse, who had watched the fray with sinking
hearts, now rent the air with their cries of despair,
but the castle was deserted by the men-at-arms, and
only Fulke Fitzwarrene, a youth of seventeen, who
was considered too young and inexperienced for
bearing arms, remained. He was of noble birth,
lord of the manor of Whittington in Salop&mdash;and
did we not see the ivy-clad ruin of his castle?&mdash;and
he had been placed in the family of de Dinan to
be trained in the noble art of warfare, the only one
considered fit for a gentleman of those days. When
he responded to the cries of the distressed ladies, the
fair Hawyse, whose beauty had already wrought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
havoc with the heart of the bashful Fulke, turned
upon him with all the fury she could summon:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coward, what doest thou loitering here when
my father, who gives thee shelter and protection,
is being done to death in yonder valley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stung by the maiden&rsquo;s words, Fulke paused
not for reply. He snatched a rusty helmet and
battleaxe from the great hall and, no war steeds being
in the castle, flung himself on a lumbering draught
horse and galloped away to his patron&rsquo;s rescue.
Shall we tell of his doughty deeds in the quaint
language and style of the old chronicler?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Fulke had a foul helmet which covered his
shoulders and at the first onset he smote Godard de
Braose, who had seized his lord, with his axe and
cut his backbone in two parts, and remounted his
lord. Fulke then turned towards Sir Andrew de
Reese and smote him on his helmet of white steel
that he split it down to the teeth. Sir Arnold de
Lys saw well that he could in no manner escape, for
he was sorely wounded and surrendered to Sir Joce.
The Lacy defended himself, but he was soon taken.
Now is Sir Walter de Lacy taken and Sir Arnold
de Lys and they are led over the river towards the
castle of Dinan. Then spoke Sir Joce, &lsquo;Friend
burgher, you are very strong and valiant; and if it
had not been for you I should have been dead before
this, I am much bound to you and shall be always.
You shall live with me and I will never fail you.&rsquo;
Then the lad answered and said, &lsquo;Sir, I am no
burgher, do you not know me, I am Fulke, your
foster child.&rsquo; &lsquo;Fair son,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;blessed be the
time that I ever nourished you, for a man will never
lose his labor that he does for a brave man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surely such a gallant feat could have but one
proper outcome and the bold Sir Fulke was soon
married to the fair Hawyse in the beautiful circular
chapel just built by her father and which stands
almost intact to charm the beholder today. And
the Right Reverend Bishop of Hereford came with
his splendid retinue to perform the ceremony. It
is a pity indeed that one may not close the pretty
tale here in the happy fashion of the modern novel,
but the wild way of the Welsh Border interferes.</p>

<p>Walter de Lacy and Arnold de Lys have escaped
from Ludlow Castle. So great is the courtesy
of their captor that he will not taste food until his
guests have dined. But one day when their meal
is ready, they cannot be found. A fair traitress in
the castle, Maid Marion of the Heath, who has
become infatuated with Arnold, has connived at their
escape, though no one knows of this at the time.</p>

<p>After the marriage, Joce and Fulke leave for
a visit in Berkshire, entrusting the castle to thirty
knights and seventy soldiers. But Maid Marion is
ill; she remains behind, only to notify Arnold de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
Lys that he will find a silken cord from one of the
castle windows and that she will draw up a ladder
for him to enter her chamber. He hastens to comply
and brings at his back an hundred men-at-arms, who
slay the sleeping knights and soldiers of the garrison
in their beds. And Marion, when she learns of the
tragedy the next morning, snatches her recreant
lover&rsquo;s sword, thrusts him through the body and in
her disappointment and despair hurls herself from the
window upon the cruel rocks far beneath.</p>

<p>When Joce and Fulke heard the astounding
news, they hastened back to Ludlow and with a
force of seven thousand men besieged DeLacy, who
was strongly entrenched in the castle. Joce pressed
the siege with great vigor, burning the great gate
and making a breach in the outer walls; and DeLacy,
as a last resort, called upon the Welsh chieftains
for assistance. These outlawed gentry were never
known to let the opportunity for a fight go begging,
and responded with twenty thousand men, forcing
Joce to appeal to King Henry. The king, who was
especially friendly to Joce, sent peremptory orders
to DeLacy to evacuate the castle forthwith, which
he did.</p>

<p class="caption">DOOR OF ROUND CHAPEL, LUDLOW CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>But we will follow the traditions of the castle
no farther. The incident related shows its wealth
of romantic associations. Its sober history is no less
full of interesting vicissitudes. It figured largely in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
the wars of the Roses; it was for many years the
home of Prince Arthur, eldest son of Henry VII.,
and his early death placed the irrepressible Henry
VIII. on the throne. For nearly two hundred years
the castle was the seat of the Lord President of the
Marches, and Ludlow was in a certain sense the
capital of the border counties. In Elizabeth&rsquo;s time
Sir Henry Sidney of Penshurst, father of the more
famous Sir Philip, was Lord President, serving for
twenty-seven years; yet he suffered from the neglect
that the queen so often showed to her most faithful
subjects, and near the close of his life he pathetically
writes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen will not be moved to reward me.
I have not now so much ground as will feed one
mutton. My lady is gone with smallpox which she
got by continually nursing her Majesty in that sickness.
I am now fifty-four years of age, toothless and
trembling, five thousand pounds in debt and thirty
thousand pounds worse than at the death of my
dear King and master, Edward VI.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sixty years later the Parliamentary cannon
planted on Whitcliff, just opposite, brought the active
history of Ludlow Castle to an end. In 1651
it was finally dismantled; the lead and timbers were
stripped from the roof, the mantels and furnishings
were sold and the fine old structure given over to
unhindered decay for nearly two hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>The fortunes of Ludlow have been closely intertwined
with those of the castle. Since the fall of
the fortress, little has happened to disturb the serenity
and quietude of the town. It is prosperous today
in a quiet way as a country market, and though it
has many visitors, it has in no sense, as yet, become
a tourist resort. One will find many fine buildings,
odd nooks and corners, and very quaint streets, all
quite devoid of any taint of modernity. The town
is deservedly proud of its parish church&mdash;as fine, perhaps,
as any in England. It occupies the opposite
end of the high rock on which the castle sits and,
after the castle, is easily the glory of Ludlow. It
is built of red sandstone, time-stained to a dull brown,
touched in places with silver gray; the shape is cruciform
and the splendid square tower with its pinnacled
corners forms a landmark for many miles from
the surrounding country. It was originally built
about 1200, on the site of an earlier church, though
of course the present almost perfect structure is the
result of thorough restoration. The windows are
unusually good, though modern, and the tower was
rebuilt and fitted with the fine mechanical peal of
bells that ring six times daily with a different refrain
for each day of the week. The tombs and
monuments are numerous, but mostly those of old-time
border dignitaries.</p>

<p>We found much pleasure in wandering about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
the town on the morning of our last visit. The commodious
market-house was filled with farmers and
their wives from the country, who offered their products
for sale, and as we mingled with them we
heard nothing spoken but English. Down toward
the castle a curiosity shop attracted our attention; a
brick and timber house which was crammed to the
very garret with antique arms, armor, jewelry, china,
glass, ivory, furniture, brass&mdash;but we might not
enumerate its contents in pages. Nor was this all,
for at a short distance an old Norman chapel had
been leased by the proprietor and it, too, was filled
to overflowing with ancient things of all degrees,
from a spoon or cup to a massive carved-oak bed
worth two hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The shop keeper, a benevolent-looking, gray-bearded
old gentleman, is an authority on antiques
and shows us many curios of astonishing value. But
his daughter is more shrewd at business. No effort
is made to sell us anything&mdash;only to interest us&mdash;and
the apparent honesty of the shop people spoils
many a deal. I am desirous of some souvenir of
Ludlow, something distinctly suggestive of the place;
an old sword, or pistol or what not, that might possibly&mdash;I
ask no more than possibly&mdash;have been used
in the frays that once raged round the castle. There
are ancient swords and pistols galore; but they are
French rapiers or Scotch claymores, and though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
eagerly seek for a mere suggestion that one of them
might possibly have come from Ludlow, I am told
that it could hardly be; such treasures have been
picked up long ago and should one be found it
would command a large price. It is a disappointment,
but it gives us confidence in the purchases we
finally make&mdash;so many, in fact, that our ready cash
is quite exhausted; but such a trifling matter is of
no consequence&mdash;we are perfectly welcome to take
the goods and send the money when we reach London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have done considerable business with
Americans,&rdquo; says the young woman. &ldquo;Were you
ever at Mount Vernon?&mdash;of course you have been.
We supplied the antiques used in furnishing Washington&rsquo;s
kitchen there. One of the ladies of the
committee happened to visit Ludlow and gave us
the order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before we finally leave the old town which has
charmed us so much, we cannot forbear a last look
at the castle, whose gray walls are flaunted by the
noonday sun. We enter the wide grass-grown court;
it is quite deserted and we make a farewell round
of the lordly though ruinous apartments. It is the
day of all days for a view from the battlements of
the keep, over which flies the red and white banner
of St. George. We climb the shattered and somewhat
precarious stairs and behold the pleasant vale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
of the Teme, lying far beneath, every feature clear
and distinct in the lucent, untainted summer day.
The verdant valley, with its silvery river, its fine
parks, its mansions, farmhouses, towns and villages,
and the far blue outlines of the Welsh hills, make a
scene quite too enchanting for any words of mine to
describe. The town just outside the castle walls
lies slumberously below the church tower, upon
which the great clock points to the hour of twelve;
the bells peal forth the melody that finds a response
always and in every heart,&mdash;doubly so in that of the
exiled wanderer&mdash;&ldquo;Home Sweet Home,&rdquo; and which
never seemed to us so strong in its appeal, for we are
to sail within the week.</p>
